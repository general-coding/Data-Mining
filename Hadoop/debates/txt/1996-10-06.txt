Information : October 6, 1996
Information : The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate
Jim Lehrer : Good evening from the Bushnell Theatre in Hartford, Connecticut.
Jim Lehrer : I'm Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS.
Jim Lehrer : Welcome to the first of the 1996 Presidential debates between President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Senator Bob Dole, the Republican nominee.
Jim Lehrer : This event is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
Jim Lehrer : It will last 90 minutes following a format and rules worked out by the two campaigns.
Jim Lehrer : There will be two-minute opening and closing statements.
Jim Lehrer : In between, a series of questions, each having three parts.
Jim Lehrer : A 90-second answer, a 60-second rebuttal, and a 30-second response.
Jim Lehrer : I will assist the candidates in adhering to those time limits with the help of a series of lights visible to both.
Jim Lehrer : Under their rules, the candidates are not allowed to question each other directly.
Jim Lehrer : I will ask the questions.
Jim Lehrer : There are no limitations on the subjects.
Jim Lehrer : The order for everything tonight was determined by coin toss.
Jim Lehrer : Now, to the opening statements and to President Clinton.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : Thank you, Jim.
Bill Clinton : And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.
Bill Clinton : I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.
Bill Clinton : Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration.
Bill Clinton : I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.
Bill Clinton : I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives.
Bill Clinton : Four years ago you took me on faith.
Bill Clinton : Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.
Bill Clinton : We are better off than we were four years ago.
Bill Clinton : Let's keep it going.
Bill Clinton : We cut the deficit by 60 percent.
Bill Clinton : Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.
Bill Clinton : We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.
Bill Clinton : Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.
Bill Clinton : We passed family and medical leave.
Bill Clinton : Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.
Bill Clinton : We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.
Bill Clinton : Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.
Bill Clinton : We passed welfare reform.
Bill Clinton : Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.
Bill Clinton : And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college.
Bill Clinton : We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.
Bill Clinton : And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, two minutes.
Bob Dole : Thank you.
Bob Dole : Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.
Bob Dole : Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.
Bob Dole : It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.
Bob Dole : I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.
Bob Dole : I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.
Bob Dole : I've learned from them that people do have tough times.
Bob Dole : And sometimes you can't go it alone.
Bob Dole : And that's what America is all about.
Bob Dole : I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .
Bob Dole : And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.
Bob Dole : America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.
Bob Dole : Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.
Bob Dole : You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.
Bob Dole : You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education.
Bob Dole : But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.
Bob Dole : And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.
Bob Dole : Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.
Bob Dole : Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.
Bob Dole : And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.
Bob Dole : It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, first question.
Jim Lehrer : There is a major difference in your view of the role of the Federal government and that of Senator Dole.
Jim Lehrer : How would you define the difference?
Bill Clinton : Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives.
Bill Clinton : That, to me, is the key.
Bill Clinton : And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.
Bill Clinton : For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.
Bill Clinton : We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.
Bill Clinton : But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.
Bill Clinton : All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.
Bill Clinton : I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.
Bill Clinton : I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.
Bill Clinton : I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people.
Bill Clinton : I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.
Bill Clinton : These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, one minute.
Bob Dole : I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.
Bob Dole : The President trusts the government.
Bob Dole : We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.
Bob Dole : One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.
Bob Dole : Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.
Bob Dole : A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America.
Bob Dole : Not just the rich.
Bob Dole : If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.
Bob Dole : We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.
Bob Dole : I guess I rely more on the individual.
Bob Dole : I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.
Bob Dole : Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.
Bob Dole : That's my difference with the President.
Bob Dole : We'll have specific differences later.
Bob Dole : He noted a few, but there are others.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, 30 seconds.
Bill Clinton : I trust the people.
Bill Clinton : We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives.
Bill Clinton : But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.
Bill Clinton : I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick.
Bill Clinton : Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents.
Bill Clinton : But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, the President said in his opening statement we are better off today than we were four years ago.
Jim Lehrer : Do you agree?
Bob Dole : Well, he's better off than he was four years ago.
Bill Clinton : I agree with that.
Bill Clinton : That's right.
Bob Dole : And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know.
Bob Dole : I looked at the slowest growth in the century.
Bob Dole : He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.
Bob Dole : We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history.
Bob Dole : We've got stagnant wages.
Bob Dole : In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.
Bob Dole : Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.
Bob Dole : So we have stagnation.
Bob Dole : We have the highest foreign debt in history.
Bob Dole : And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?
Bob Dole : Well, I guess some may be better off.
Bob Dole : Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.
Bob Dole : Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.
Bob Dole : But are the American people?
Bob Dole : They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes.
Bob Dole : For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.
Bob Dole : More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.
Bob Dole : So some may be better off.
Bob Dole : They talk about family income being up.
Bob Dole : That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.
Bob Dole : And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.
Bob Dole : One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.
Bob Dole : We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.
Bob Dole : That's what America is all about.
Jim Lehrer : One minute, Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.
Bill Clinton : We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.
Bill Clinton : Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade.
Bill Clinton : We have record numbers of new small businesses.
Bill Clinton : We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.
Bill Clinton : All groups of people are growing.
Bill Clinton : We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.
Bill Clinton : The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.
Bill Clinton : So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago.
Bill Clinton : Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.
Bill Clinton : How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.
Bill Clinton : That's what I want to focus on.
Bill Clinton : But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole.
Bob Dole : I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.
Bob Dole : But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.
Bob Dole : We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.
Bob Dole : It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.
Bob Dole : Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children.
Bob Dole : Are your children getting a better education.
Bob Dole : Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America.
Bob Dole : Crime has gone down but it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.
Bob Dole : So, yes, some may be better off.
Bob Dole : But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, Senator Dole has come pretty close in the last few days to accusing you of lying about his position on Medicare reform.
Jim Lehrer : Have you done so?
Bill Clinton : Absolutely not.
Bill Clinton : Let's look at the position.
Bill Clinton : First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members.
Bill Clinton : He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time.
Bill Clinton : That's what he said.
Bill Clinton : Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund.
Bill Clinton : It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more.
Bill Clinton : The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.
Bill Clinton : And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.
Bill Clinton : Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.
Bill Clinton : And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.
Bill Clinton : But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.
Bill Clinton : We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole.
Bob Dole : Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it.
Bob Dole : I thought it was a good program.
Bob Dole : But I've supported Medicare ever since.
Bob Dole : In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.
Bob Dole : I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.
Bob Dole : In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House.
Bob Dole : I'm concerned about healthcare.
Bob Dole : I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.
Bob Dole : It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke.
Bob Dole : He doesn't fix it for ten years.
Bob Dole : We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida.
Bob Dole : And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.
Bob Dole : Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart.
Bob Dole : I think it's time to have a truce.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission.
Bill Clinton : But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed.
Bill Clinton : I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.
Bill Clinton : My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.
Bill Clinton : We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.
Bill Clinton : But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, speaking of your tax plan, do you still think that's a good idea, the 15 percent across the board tax cut?
Bob Dole : Oh, yes.
Bob Dole : And you'll be eligible.
Bill Clinton : Me too?
Bob Dole : And so will the former President, yes.
Bill Clinton : I need it.
Bob Dole : Well, the people need it, that's the point.
Bob Dole : This is not a Wall Street tax cut.
Bob Dole : This is a family tax cut.
Bob Dole : This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.
Bob Dole : Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.
Bob Dole : This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.
Bob Dole : First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.
Bob Dole : He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.
Bob Dole : It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.
Bob Dole : It's a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent.
Bob Dole : So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.
Bob Dole : It's a state tax relief.
Bob Dole : It's a $500 per child tax credit.
Bob Dole : It's about litigation reforms.
Bob Dole : Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision.
Bob Dole : In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.
Bob Dole : And it's also regulatory reform.
Bob Dole : It's a good package, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : We'd like to have your support.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.
Bill Clinton : It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.
Bill Clinton : It's not good to raise the deficit.
Bill Clinton : We worked too hard to lower it.
Bill Clinton : It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.
Bill Clinton : So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that's the right way to go.
Bob Dole : The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years.
Bob Dole : I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.
Bob Dole : I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.
Bob Dole : We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people.
Bob Dole : You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.
Bob Dole : It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, the Senator mentioned trial lawyers and campaign, that means campaign financing.
Jim Lehrer : How do you personally avoid being unduly influenced by people who give you money or give you services in your campaigns?
Bill Clinton : Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.
Bill Clinton : The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.
Bill Clinton : In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill.
Bill Clinton : And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.
Bill Clinton : Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.
Bill Clinton : Now, let me just give you an example.
Bill Clinton : I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.
Bill Clinton : The drunk driver had no money.
Bill Clinton : Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery.
Bill Clinton : I thought that was wrong.
Bill Clinton : So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.
Bill Clinton : But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.
Bill Clinton : I've done a lot of things that were controversial.
Bill Clinton : My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.
Bill Clinton : Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.
Bill Clinton : That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole.
Bob Dole : How does he avoid conflict?
Bob Dole : Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers.
Bob Dole : I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot.
Bob Dole : Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn.
Bob Dole : I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.
Bob Dole : The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.
Bob Dole : We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.
Bob Dole : But we're lawyers, I like lawyers.
Bob Dole : I don't dislike trial lawyers.
Bob Dole : But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.
Bob Dole : You're putting a lot of business people out of business.
Bob Dole : Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.
Bob Dole : I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world.
Bob Dole : So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.
Bob Dole : And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : And I will address you as Mr. President.
Bob Dole : You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.
Bill Clinton : I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.
Bill Clinton : Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.
Bill Clinton : And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws.
Bill Clinton : That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.
Bob Dole : That's not true.
Bill Clinton : So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.
Bill Clinton : I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.
Jim Lehrer : Well, Senator Dole, let me ask you the same question I asked the President: How do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaigns?
Bob Dole : I think it's very difficult.
Bob Dole : Let's be honest about it.
Bob Dole : That's why we need campaign finance reform.
Bob Dole : That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.
Bob Dole : We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.
Bob Dole : And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.
Bob Dole : Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform.
Bob Dole : I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.
Bob Dole : We tried six or eight years ago.
Bob Dole : He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.
Bob Dole : We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.
Bob Dole : You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago.
Bob Dole : We have a commission on campaign finance reform.
Bob Dole : They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.
Bob Dole : That's how it works.
Bob Dole : We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.
Bob Dole : But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.
Bob Dole : I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.
Bob Dole : But I want to go back to 1965.
Bob Dole : That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes.
Bob Dole : And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.
Bob Dole : We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.
Bob Dole : All 50 states did it.
Bob Dole : It took three and a half years.
Bob Dole : It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.
Bob Dole : What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?
Bob Dole : Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.
Bob Dole : It seems to me that you have a selective memory.
Bob Dole : You know, mine doesn't work that way.
Bob Dole : So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.
Bill Clinton : Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.
Bill Clinton : But let me respond to what you said.
Bill Clinton : I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.
Bill Clinton : That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.
Bill Clinton : So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.
Bill Clinton : And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.
Bill Clinton : And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.
Bill Clinton : I strongly supported it.
Bill Clinton : And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.
Bill Clinton : And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.
Bill Clinton : So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.
Bill Clinton : And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, 30 seconds.
Bob Dole : Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.
Bob Dole : Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.
Bob Dole : Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : These are sophisticated people watching tonight.
Bob Dole : Millions and millions of Americans.
Bob Dole : They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.
Bob Dole : They know the Democratic party won't do it.
Bob Dole : We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.
Bob Dole : And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, the Senator mentioned drugs.
Jim Lehrer : He suggested that you are -- you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenagers in the United States.
Jim Lehrer : Is he right?
Bill Clinton : Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.
Bill Clinton : I am.
Bill Clinton : But let's look at the overall record.
Bill Clinton : Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.
Bill Clinton : The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.
Bill Clinton : Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.
Bill Clinton : I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.
Bill Clinton : The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.
Bill Clinton : We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.
Bill Clinton : We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.
Bill Clinton : We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.
Bill Clinton : And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.
Bill Clinton : Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you.
Bill Clinton : Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.
Bill Clinton : I think we all do.
Bill Clinton : And I hope we can do better.
Bill Clinton : I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.
Bill Clinton : I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.
Jim Lehrer : Senator.
Bob Dole : Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.
Bob Dole : I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.
Bob Dole : But it seems to me the record is clear.
Bob Dole : The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.
Bob Dole : Drug use doubled.
Bob Dole : You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.
Bob Dole : But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.
Bob Dole : You cut interdiction substantially.
Bob Dole : I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.
Bob Dole : And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.
Bob Dole : This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.
Bob Dole : And we have a responsibility.
Bob Dole : You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.
Bob Dole : Is that the kind of leadership we need?
Bob Dole : And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.
Bob Dole : But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.
Bill Clinton : That's what I thought we ought to do.
Bill Clinton : Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.
Bill Clinton : And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.
Bill Clinton : I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.
Bill Clinton : We just have a different approach.
Bill Clinton : But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.
Bill Clinton : I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.
Bill Clinton : We need to do this together and we can.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, on the government, continuing to talk about the government's role.
Jim Lehrer : If elected President, would you seek to repeal the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons?
Bob Dole : Not if I didn't have a better idea.
Bob Dole : But I've got a better idea.
Bob Dole : It's something I've worked on for 15 years.
Bob Dole : It's called the automated check or the instant check.
Bob Dole : It's being used in 17 states right now.
Bob Dole : States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states.
Bob Dole : You don't buy any gun.
Bob Dole : You don't get any gun.
Bob Dole : We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.
Bob Dole : We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
Bob Dole : And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.
Bob Dole : I've been working on this for a long, long time.
Bob Dole : You walk in, you put your little card in there.
Bob Dole : If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.
Bob Dole : You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.
Bob Dole : If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.
Bob Dole : The administration says they support the instant check.
Bob Dole : They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.
Bob Dole : In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.
Bob Dole : This keeps up with technology.
Bob Dole : It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.
Bob Dole : That is the bottom line.
Bob Dole : And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.
Bob Dole : And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.
Bob Dole : You talk about the Brady Bill.
Bob Dole : There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.
Bob Dole : And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.
Bob Dole : Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban.
Bill Clinton : And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.
Bill Clinton : But let's look at the facts here.
Bill Clinton : The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.
Bill Clinton : Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.
Bill Clinton : He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.
Bill Clinton : He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.
Bill Clinton : Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.
Bill Clinton : But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.
Bill Clinton : I mean, their rifles.
Bill Clinton : We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids.
Bill Clinton : And this is a safer country.
Bill Clinton : So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.
Bob Dole : Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.
Bob Dole : I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.
Bob Dole : But that's history.
Bob Dole : I told the NRA that's history.
Bob Dole : You're not going to worry about it anymore.
Bob Dole : I'm not going to worry about it anymore.
Bob Dole : Let's do something better.
Bob Dole : Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : Talking about this and this.
Bob Dole : You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.
Bob Dole : It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned.
Bob Dole : So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, Senator Dole said the other day that you practiced a photo-op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the United States throughout the world.
Jim Lehrer : Is he wrong about that?
Bill Clinton : If he, that's what he said, he's not right about that.
Bill Clinton : Look at where we are today.
Bill Clinton : The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.
Bill Clinton : I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.
Bill Clinton : We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.
Bill Clinton : The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.
Bill Clinton : The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.
Bill Clinton : And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.
Bill Clinton : There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.
Bill Clinton : We have worked hard for peace and freedom.
Bill Clinton : When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States.
Bill Clinton : When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.
Bill Clinton : Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.
Bill Clinton : Peace in Bosnia.
Bill Clinton : We just had the election there.
Bill Clinton : We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East.
Bill Clinton : We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.
Bill Clinton : The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.
Jim Lehrer : Senator.
Bob Dole : Well, I have a different view.
Bob Dole : Again, I˘âĴâ˘ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year.
Bob Dole : Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.
Bob Dole : But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.
Bob Dole : They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.
Bob Dole : They asked for the tanks.
Bob Dole : They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.
Bob Dole : It's called mission creep.
Bob Dole : We turn it over to the United Nations.
Bob Dole : The President didn't have much to do about it.
Bob Dole : You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.
Bob Dole : You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.
Bob Dole : So we need more protection from America.
Bob Dole : Bosnia, Northern Ireland.
Bob Dole : There's no ceasefire in Bosnia.
Bob Dole : I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.
Bob Dole : We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.
Bob Dole : We haven't done that.
Bob Dole : We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home.
Bob Dole : Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.
Bill Clinton : I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.
Bill Clinton : Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.
Bill Clinton : Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.
Bill Clinton : And institutions are beginning to function.
Bill Clinton : In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.
Bill Clinton : There will always be problems in this whole world.
Bill Clinton : But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, if elected president, what criteria would you use to decide when to send U.S. troops into harm's way.
Bob Dole : Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.
Bob Dole : Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.
Bob Dole : Now I think we have a selective engagement policy.
Bob Dole : We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.
Bob Dole : And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.
Bob Dole : They decided.
Bob Dole : He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.
Bob Dole : It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.
Bob Dole : Look these are facts.
Bob Dole : And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.
Bob Dole : He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.
Bob Dole : That would be my position.
Bob Dole : Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.
Bob Dole : We all fight over how much money is there.
Bob Dole : I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money.
Bob Dole : You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.
Bob Dole : Devastated states like California and others.
Bob Dole : And I think now we've got a problem.
Bob Dole : We've got to go back and look.
Bob Dole : It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.
Bob Dole : You may have said that, too.
Bob Dole : But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.
Bob Dole : We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.
Bill Clinton : Our military is the strongest military in the world.
Bill Clinton : It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.
Bill Clinton : There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.
Bill Clinton : We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.
Bill Clinton : I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.
Bill Clinton : That is my solemn obligation.
Bill Clinton : You ask when do you decide to deploy them.
Bill Clinton : The interests of the American people must be at stake.
Bill Clinton : Our values must be at stake.
Bill Clinton : We have to be able to make a difference.
Bill Clinton : And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.
Bill Clinton : But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait.
Bill Clinton : When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.
Bill Clinton : When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.
Bill Clinton : I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole.
Bob Dole : Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.
Bob Dole : You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.
Bob Dole : We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.
Bob Dole : They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.
Bob Dole : We lost 53,000 Americans.
Bob Dole : We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.
Bob Dole : It's a closed society.
Bob Dole : We don't have any inspection.
Bob Dole : We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives.
Bob Dole : Someone called them something else.
Bob Dole : Incentives.
Bob Dole : We don't know what's going to happen.
Bob Dole : Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.
Bob Dole : And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated?
Bill Clinton : Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy.
Bill Clinton : In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.
Bill Clinton : We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.
Bill Clinton : Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.
Bill Clinton : They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation.
Bill Clinton : Senator Dole is correct.
Bill Clinton : I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.
Bill Clinton : And the United States needs help from other countries.
Bill Clinton : Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.
Bill Clinton : But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.
Bill Clinton : Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba.
Bill Clinton : And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.
Bob Dole : That's the point I made.
Bob Dole : We have to be firm and strong.
Bob Dole : And I hope that will happen.
Bob Dole : It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.
Bob Dole : We have not been firm and strong.
Bob Dole : You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.
Bob Dole : It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.
Bob Dole : In my view, the policy has failed.
Bob Dole : So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.
Bob Dole : But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year.
Bob Dole : A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.
Bob Dole : And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.
Bob Dole : When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.
Bob Dole : When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.
Bob Dole : This is a serious business.
Bob Dole : It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.
Bill Clinton : There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.
Bill Clinton : Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.
Bill Clinton : His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.
Bill Clinton : And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.
Bill Clinton : So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, you mentioned health reform several times.
Jim Lehrer : What do you think should be done about the healthcare system?
Bob Dole : Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.
Bob Dole : We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.
Bob Dole : I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.
Bob Dole : Healthcare.
Bob Dole : Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.
Bob Dole : The President was opposed to it in 1993.
Bob Dole : He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.
Bob Dole : Most people want to see their own doctor.
Bob Dole : They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.
Bob Dole : We won't threaten anybody.
Bob Dole : So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.
Bob Dole : We've been for that for four, five, six years.
Bob Dole : The President held it up.
Bob Dole : And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.
Bob Dole : But it will cover preexisting conditions.
Bob Dole : If you change your job, you're going to be covered.
Bob Dole : So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.
Bob Dole : But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.
Bob Dole : Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.
Bob Dole : It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.
Bill Clinton : Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.
Bill Clinton : Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.
Bill Clinton : And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.
Bill Clinton : Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.
Bill Clinton : The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.
Bill Clinton : I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.
Bob Dole : Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.
Bob Dole : You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start.
Bob Dole : I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.
Bob Dole : There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.
Bob Dole : Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.
Bob Dole : In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.
Jim Lehrer : Senator, go ahead and finish your sentence.
Bob Dole : All right.
Bob Dole : Food.
Jim Lehrer : Back to foreign affairs for a moment, Mr. President.
Jim Lehrer : Are you satisfied with the way you handled this last Iraq crisis and the end result?
Bill Clinton : Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances.
Bill Clinton : Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.
Bill Clinton : Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now.
Bill Clinton : What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something.
Bill Clinton : We did not feel that I could commit.
Bill Clinton : I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.
Bill Clinton : So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.
Bill Clinton : We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.
Bill Clinton : Was it the right thing to do?
Bill Clinton : I believe it was.
Bill Clinton : Is it fully effective?
Bill Clinton : Did it make him withdraw from the north?
Bill Clinton : Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue.
Bill Clinton : We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.
Bill Clinton : We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole.
Bob Dole : Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.
Bob Dole : I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.
Bob Dole : And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.
Bob Dole : Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.
Bob Dole : We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.
Bob Dole : It involves Turkey.
Bob Dole : It's a real problem.
Bob Dole : Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.
Bob Dole : We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.
Bob Dole : Did we inflict any damage?
Bob Dole : No.
Bob Dole : Did we have any allies helping?
Bob Dole : Well, we have Great Britain.
Bob Dole : They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.
Bob Dole : And of course Kuwait.
Bob Dole : Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.
Bob Dole : We had to get their permission.
Bob Dole : The bottom line is, we went in there alone.
Bob Dole : We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.
Bob Dole : We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.
Bill Clinton : Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.
Bob Dole : It's not the U.N.
Bill Clinton : Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.
Bill Clinton : Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.
Bill Clinton : I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.
Bill Clinton : It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.
Bill Clinton : That's what I did.
Bill Clinton : I still believe it was the right thing to do.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, on your photo-op foreign policy charge against the President --
Bob Dole : Not mine.
Jim Lehrer : Oh, No, no.
Jim Lehrer : I mean your charge against the President, that he has a photo-op foreign policy.
Jim Lehrer : Does the Middle East summit last week fall into that category?
Bob Dole : Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category?
Bob Dole : I don't know.
Bob Dole : I want to be very serious.
Bob Dole : I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.
Bob Dole : I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.
Bob Dole : So it's not that we always disagree.
Bob Dole : Others disagreed with us.
Bob Dole : The Mideast is very difficult.
Bob Dole : But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.
Bob Dole : Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.
Bob Dole : Maybe that was the purpose.
Bob Dole : And I know talks have started again today.
Bob Dole : But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.
Bob Dole : It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.
Bob Dole : Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.
Bob Dole : I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.
Bob Dole : We've lost credibility around the world.
Bob Dole : Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.
Bob Dole : Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.
Bob Dole : But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.
Bob Dole : And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.
Bill Clinton : We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace.
Bill Clinton : It is a very difficult environment.
Bill Clinton : The feelings are very strong.
Bill Clinton : There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.
Bill Clinton : Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.
Bill Clinton : I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.
Bill Clinton : And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.
Bill Clinton : I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.
Bill Clinton : Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole.
Bob Dole : Well, I was disappointed.
Bob Dole : The President has not called for an unconditional end to the violence.
Bob Dole : It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.
Bob Dole : The killing and tragedies had taken place.
Bob Dole : And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it.
Bob Dole : It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.
Bob Dole : And I don't intend to politicize it.
Bob Dole : I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.
Bill Clinton : Thank you.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, in your acceptance speech in Chicago, you said the real choice in this race is, quote, whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past; about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us; about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where you're on your own, end quote.
Jim Lehrer : Are you saying that you believe Senator Dole is a man of the past and if elected president he would lead the country backward?
Bill Clinton : Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past.
Bill Clinton : And I think I know what he meant by that.
Bill Clinton : He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.
Bill Clinton : But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.
Bill Clinton : That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.
Bill Clinton : And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates.
Bill Clinton : That's why we're moving in the right direction.
Bill Clinton : And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.
Bill Clinton : That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.
Bill Clinton : That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it's got to be paid for.
Bill Clinton : That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.
Bill Clinton : These are my commitments.
Bill Clinton : I am very oriented toward the future.
Bill Clinton : I think this election has to be geared toward the future.
Bill Clinton : I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole.
Bob Dole : You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive.
Bob Dole : But Kenny was a great talker.
Bob Dole : And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.
Bob Dole : So we always had a rule, we divided by six.
Bob Dole : Maybe in your case maybe just two.
Bob Dole : But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.
Bob Dole : So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.
Bob Dole : He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.
Bob Dole : When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.
Bob Dole : I also want a bridge to the truth.
Bob Dole : We have to tell the truth.
Bob Dole : We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.
Bob Dole : And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.
Bob Dole : We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.
Bill Clinton : But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.
Bill Clinton : I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem.
Bill Clinton : But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.
Bill Clinton : Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.
Bill Clinton : If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.
Bill Clinton : I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education.
Bob Dole : Yes.
Bob Dole : I didn't favor it when it was in, started.
Bob Dole : I voted against it.
Bob Dole : It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.
Bob Dole : So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.
Bob Dole : Now, some say, oh, you're a Republican, you can't be reaching out to these people.
Bob Dole : I've reached out to people all my life.
Bob Dole : I've worked on the food stamp program, proudly.
Bob Dole : And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.
Bob Dole : I'm not some extremist out here.
Bob Dole : I care about people.
Bob Dole : I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled.
Bob Dole : I don't advertise it.
Bob Dole : Just did, haven't before.
Bob Dole : And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.
Bob Dole : So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.
Bob Dole : I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.
Bob Dole : I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.
Bob Dole : But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.
Bob Dole : Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.
Bob Dole : I'm excited about it.
Bob Dole : It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.
Bill Clinton : Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.
Bill Clinton : We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.
Bill Clinton : There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.
Bill Clinton : The ones that are out there are doing well.
Bill Clinton : What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.
Bill Clinton : If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.
Bill Clinton : But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.
Bill Clinton : He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools.
Bill Clinton : He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.
Bill Clinton : That's the issue.
Bill Clinton : 90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.
Bob Dole : I'd better correct the President.
Bob Dole : I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.
Bob Dole : I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.
Bob Dole : I've supported all the education programs.
Bob Dole : I've supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it.
Bob Dole : So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.
Bob Dole : Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.
Bob Dole : Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, what is wrong with the school choice proposal?
Bill Clinton : I support school choice.
Bill Clinton : I support school choice.
Bill Clinton : I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.
Bill Clinton : But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.
Bill Clinton : I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards.
Bill Clinton : Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.
Bill Clinton : I have been a strong force for reform.
Bill Clinton : And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.
Bill Clinton : I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.
Bill Clinton : I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.
Bill Clinton : And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.
Bill Clinton : It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships.
Bill Clinton : Now, it would have.
Bill Clinton : That's a fact.
Bill Clinton : That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.
Bill Clinton : We need to be doing more in education, not less.
Bob Dole : Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.
Bob Dole : It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.
Bob Dole : We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down.
Bob Dole : And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.
Bob Dole : I like young people.
Bob Dole : I like teachers.
Bob Dole : I'm a product of a public school.
Bob Dole : You attended a private school for some time in your life.
Bob Dole : I like teachers.
Bob Dole : You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again.
Bob Dole : When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.
Bob Dole : And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.
Bob Dole : You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.
Bob Dole : Now that's not reform, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.
Bob Dole : Some schools aren't safe.
Bob Dole : Some schools aren't even safe.
Bob Dole : Your choice is nothing.
Bob Dole : Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.
Bob Dole : If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.
Bill Clinton : First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight.
Bill Clinton : I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.
Bill Clinton : And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there.
Bill Clinton : You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.
Bill Clinton : Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.
Bill Clinton : If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.
Bill Clinton : I might say the results are highly ambiguous.
Bill Clinton : But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.
Bill Clinton : It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, at the Republican convention you said the following and I quote, it is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration a core of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes, end quote.
Jim Lehrer : Whom precisely and what precisely did you have in mind?
Bob Dole : I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration.
Bob Dole : And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.
Bob Dole : Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things.
Bob Dole : I feel strongly about education.
Bob Dole : I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights.
Bob Dole : We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.
Bob Dole : Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.
Bob Dole : It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money.
Bob Dole : It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.
Bob Dole : But this is a very liberal administration.
Bob Dole : This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut.
Bob Dole : This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system.
Bob Dole : This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business.
Bob Dole : This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind.
Bob Dole : I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.
Bob Dole : There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.
Bob Dole : There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.
Bill Clinton : When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about.
Bill Clinton : And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.
Bill Clinton : It's sort of their golden oldie, you know.
Bill Clinton : It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.
Bill Clinton : And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.
Bill Clinton : The American people should make up their own mind.
Bill Clinton : Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.
Bill Clinton : We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.
Bill Clinton : We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.
Bill Clinton : We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.
Bill Clinton : The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.
Bill Clinton : Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.
Bob Dole : Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.
Bob Dole : You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.
Bob Dole : The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.
Bob Dole : And even some in your own party couldn't buy that.
Bob Dole : I remember talking by the telephone.
Bob Dole : I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.
Bob Dole : I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about.
Bob Dole : In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.
Bob Dole : And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we've done a good job.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, if you're not a liberal, describe your political philosophy.
Bill Clinton : I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.
Bill Clinton : I don't believe in discrimination.
Bill Clinton : I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy.
Bill Clinton : I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.
Bill Clinton : It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.
Bill Clinton : And I did stop them, I admit that.
Bill Clinton : I sure stopped their budget.
Bill Clinton : Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.
Bill Clinton : It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.
Bill Clinton : It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.
Bill Clinton : Their budget weakened our support for education.
Bill Clinton : $30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans.
Bill Clinton : Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.
Bill Clinton : It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.
Bill Clinton : It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.
Bob Dole : Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.
Bob Dole : Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.
Bob Dole : George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal.
Bob Dole : I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.
Bob Dole : Whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever.
Bob Dole : And so I think you take a look at it.
Bob Dole : The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.
Bob Dole : They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.
Bob Dole : Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?
Bob Dole : Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money?
Bob Dole : That's why we want an economic package.
Bob Dole : We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.
Bob Dole : That's what our message is to the people watching.
Bob Dole : Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.
Bill Clinton : The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.
Bill Clinton : And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, we've talked mostly now about differences between the two of you that relate to policy issues and that sort of thing.
Jim Lehrer : Are there also significant differences in the more personal area that are relevant to this election?
Bob Dole : Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut.
Bob Dole : I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.
Bob Dole : So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.
Bob Dole : The people want economic reform.
Bob Dole : They're having a hard time making ends meet.
Bob Dole : You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.
Bob Dole : This is important business.
Bob Dole : This is about getting the economy moving again.
Bob Dole : This is about American jobs and opportunities.
Bob Dole : It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.
Bob Dole : When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money.
Bob Dole : I think the government can do better.
Bob Dole : Are there personal differences?
Jim Lehrer : That are relevant to this.
Bob Dole : Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign.
Bob Dole : So I think he's a bit taller than I am.
Bob Dole : But I think there are personal differences.
Bob Dole : I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.
Bob Dole : As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.
Bob Dole : It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.
Bob Dole : And not about personal things.
Bob Dole : You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.
Bob Dole : I know he wants to disown it.
Bob Dole : I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.
Bob Dole : The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances.
Bill Clinton : But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.
Bill Clinton : I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000.
Bill Clinton : Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read.
Bill Clinton : Investing in our environment.
Bill Clinton : Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.
Bill Clinton : Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.
Bill Clinton : Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.
Bill Clinton : Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.
Bill Clinton : It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.
Bill Clinton : Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.
Bob Dole : Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.
Bob Dole : You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.
Bob Dole : It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts.
Bob Dole : Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.
Bob Dole : I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show.
Bob Dole : And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally.
Bob Dole : I'm not discussing Whitewater now.
Bob Dole : But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons.
Bob Dole : And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
Bill Clinton : Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.
Bill Clinton : He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.
Bill Clinton : Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.
Bill Clinton : This is an issue they've brought up.
Bill Clinton : It's under, there's been no consideration of it, no discussion of it.
Bill Clinton : I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.
Bill Clinton : And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.
Bill Clinton : This is something I take seriously and that's my position.
Bob Dole : But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.
Bob Dole : Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.
Bob Dole : I mean, you may be sending a signal.
Bob Dole : I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.
Bob Dole : But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.
Bob Dole : And I think he made a mistake.
Bob Dole : And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.
Bob Dole : But apparently his position hasn't changed.
Bob Dole : If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.
Bob Dole : We've had that discussion.
Bob Dole : And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.
Bob Dole : And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.
Bill Clinton : You bet.
Bob Dole : I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.
Bob Dole : You know, so one of your liberal friends.
Bill Clinton : Thank you.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, 30 seconds.
Bill Clinton : No comment.
Bob Dole : What's the subject matter?
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voters to have in their mind about President Clinton on a policy matter or a personal matter, what would it be?
Jim Lehrer : Something to know about him, understand it and appreciate it.
Bob Dole : See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.
Bob Dole : I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.
Bob Dole : I happen to like President Clinton personally.
Bob Dole : I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.
Bob Dole : I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.
Bob Dole : But I respect the presidency.
Bob Dole : I've served under a number of presidents.
Bob Dole : They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.
Bob Dole : So I'd rather talk about my strengths.
Bob Dole : And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.
Bob Dole : It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.
Bob Dole : You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens.
Bob Dole : I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.
Bob Dole : I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.
Bob Dole : I have relatives on Medicare.
Bob Dole : I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents.
Bob Dole : I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.
Bob Dole : And I'll keep my word on the economic package.
Bob Dole : If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.
Bob Dole : People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.
Bob Dole : That's what this race is all about.
Bill Clinton : I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.
Bill Clinton : And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.
Bill Clinton : But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan.
Bill Clinton : A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform.
Bill Clinton : A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work.
Bill Clinton : Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work.
Bill Clinton : A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while.
Bill Clinton : A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.
Bill Clinton : That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.
Bill Clinton : And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.
Bill Clinton : The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.
Bill Clinton : And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.
Bill Clinton : We just see the world in different ways.
Bill Clinton : And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.
Bob Dole : Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.
Bob Dole : I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program.
Bob Dole : We now have 2500 hospices.
Bob Dole : As I said, I've worked all my life when I was in the Congress.
Bob Dole : I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.
Bob Dole : President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.
Bob Dole : He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.
Bob Dole : But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.
Bob Dole : I wasn't just getting more power and more power.
Bob Dole : So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.
Bob Dole : We can give you all these numbers, they don't mean a thing.
Bob Dole : If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?
Bob Dole : You know, America's best days are ahead of us.
Bob Dole : I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, what do you say to Senator Dole's point that this election is about keeping one's word?
Bill Clinton : Let's look at that.
Bill Clinton : When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.
Bill Clinton : I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.
Bill Clinton : We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses.
Bill Clinton : I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.
Bill Clinton : I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.
Bill Clinton : I said we'd get tougher with child support and child support enforcement's up 50 percent.
Bill Clinton : I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.
Bill Clinton : The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.
Bill Clinton : I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.
Bill Clinton : Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.
Bill Clinton : We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.
Bill Clinton : But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.
Bill Clinton : And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.
Jim Lehrer : Senator.
Bob Dole : Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.
Bob Dole : He didn't do all these things.
Bob Dole : Let's take all these four years in a row.
Bob Dole : He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.
Bob Dole : The S & L crisis was over, they're starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in.
Bob Dole : And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.
Bob Dole : He talks about a smaller government.
Bob Dole : There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.
Bob Dole : They're gone.
Bob Dole : The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not.
Bob Dole : In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.
Bob Dole : So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due.
Bob Dole : Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs.
Bob Dole : So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland.
Bob Dole : A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.
Bob Dole : When I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.
Bill Clinton : I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.
Bill Clinton : But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.
Bill Clinton : Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.
Bill Clinton : We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.
Bill Clinton : It is not midnight in America, Senator.
Bill Clinton : We are better off than we were four years ago.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : That's the last question, the last answer.
Jim Lehrer : Let's go now to the closing statements.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, you're first.
Jim Lehrer : Two minutes.
Bill Clinton : Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.
Bill Clinton : I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.
Bill Clinton : I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.
Bill Clinton : I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago.
Bill Clinton : And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.
Bill Clinton : And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.
Bill Clinton : I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.
Bill Clinton : The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again.
Bill Clinton : All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children.
Bill Clinton : And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.
Bill Clinton : I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Bill Clinton : I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.
Bill Clinton : Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Dole, your closing statement, sir.
Bob Dole : Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening.
Bob Dole : I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century.
Bob Dole : They're the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same.
Bob Dole : You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people.
Bob Dole : And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.
Bob Dole : It's important, it's their future.
Bob Dole : And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.
Bob Dole : And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it.
Bob Dole : And I know that I'm someone older than you.
Bob Dole : But I've had my anxious moments in my life.
Bob Dole : I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.
Bob Dole : I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.
Bob Dole : I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.
Bob Dole : We are the greatest country on the face of the earth.
Bob Dole : We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.
Bob Dole : This is important business.
Bob Dole : This election is important.
Bob Dole : I ask for your support, I ask for your help.
