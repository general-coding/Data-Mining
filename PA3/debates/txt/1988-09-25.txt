Information : The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate
Jim Lehrer : Good evening.
Jim Lehrer : On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates I am pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of the 1988 campaign.
Jim Lehrer : I'm Jim Lehrer of the McNeil-Lehrer News Hour.
Jim Lehrer : My colleagues on the panel are John Mashek of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution; Ann Groer of The Orlando Sentinel; and Peter Jennings of ABC News.
Jim Lehrer : For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates for president of the United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two candidates.
Jim Lehrer : The candidates are Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee.
Jim Lehrer : (Applause)
Jim Lehrer : Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters.
Jim Lehrer : The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush.
Jim Lehrer : It is a domestic question.
Jim Lehrer : You have two minutes for an answer, sir.
Jim Lehrer : The polls say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs.
Jim Lehrer : What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs?
George Bush : I think we've seen a deterioration of values.
George Bush : I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.
George Bush : For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.
George Bush : So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.
George Bush : We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.
George Bush : And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.
George Bush : And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.
George Bush : But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes.
George Bush : We've got to get after the users more.
George Bush : We have to change this whole culture.
George Bush : "You know, I saw a movie - ""Crocodile Dundee."""
George Bush : And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.
George Bush : And it's bad.
George Bush : Everybody ought to be in this thing.
George Bush : Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.
George Bush : And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.
George Bush : But we have got to instill values in these young people.
George Bush : And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.
George Bush : But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, you have one minute to respond.
Michael Dukakis : I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.
Michael Dukakis : But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.
Michael Dukakis : That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.
Michael Dukakis : Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.
Michael Dukakis : We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.
Michael Dukakis : Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.
Michael Dukakis : I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.
Michael Dukakis : We're providing that young woman with help.
Michael Dukakis : But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.
Michael Dukakis : Values begin at the top, in the White House.
Michael Dukakis : Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, a follow-up question.
Jim Lehrer : You have two minutes to answer it.
Jim Lehrer : Are you suggesting, sir, that President Reagan is one of the causes of the drug problem in this country?
Michael Dukakis : I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.
Michael Dukakis : And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.
Michael Dukakis : But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.
Michael Dukakis : Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.
Michael Dukakis : But we also have to take demand seriously.
Michael Dukakis : You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.
Michael Dukakis : We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.
Michael Dukakis : Doing better in the neighborhoods.
Michael Dukakis : But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, you have one minute to respond.
Michael Dukakis : I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.
Michael Dukakis : But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.
Michael Dukakis : That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.
Michael Dukakis : Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.
Michael Dukakis : We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.
Michael Dukakis : Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.
Michael Dukakis : I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.
Michael Dukakis : We're providing that young woman with help.
Michael Dukakis : But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.
Michael Dukakis : Values begin at the top, in the White House.
Michael Dukakis : Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, a follow-up question.
Jim Lehrer : You have two minutes to answer it.
Jim Lehrer : Are you suggesting, sir, that President Reagan is one of the causes of the drug problem in this country?
Michael Dukakis : I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.
Michael Dukakis : And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.
Michael Dukakis : But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.

Michael Dukakis : But we also have to take demand seriously.
Michael Dukakis : You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.
Michael Dukakis : We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.
Michael Dukakis : And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.
Michael Dukakis : We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.
Michael Dukakis : And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.
Michael Dukakis : And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.
Michael Dukakis : I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.
Michael Dukakis : If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.
Jim Lehrer : A minute to rebut, Mr. Vice President.
George Bush : Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.
George Bush : I asked for and received the same briefing.
George Bush : I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.
George Bush : And what I'm about to say is unclassified.
George Bush : Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.
George Bush : It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.
George Bush : And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.
George Bush : And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.
George Bush : Panama is a friendly country.
George Bush : I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.
George Bush : And we want to bring him to justice.
George Bush : And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.
Jim Lehrer : All right, the next question will be asked by John Mashek.
Jim Lehrer : It goes to Governor Dukakis, and you'll have two minutes to answer.
John Mashek : Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit.
John Mashek : In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort.
John Mashek : Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?
Michael Dukakis : Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.
Michael Dukakis : And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.
Michael Dukakis : First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.
Michael Dukakis : Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make.
Michael Dukakis : I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.
Michael Dukakis : Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.
Michael Dukakis : Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.
Michael Dukakis : Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.
Michael Dukakis : And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.
Michael Dukakis : It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.
Michael Dukakis : I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.
Michael Dukakis : We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.
Michael Dukakis : We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.
Michael Dukakis : The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.
Michael Dukakis : He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.
Michael Dukakis : He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.
Michael Dukakis : If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.
Michael Dukakis : (Laughter)
Michael Dukakis : But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.
Michael Dukakis : I will say this -
Jim Lehrer : Your two minutes is up, Governor.
Michael Dukakis : If he's serious about what he's saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he's going to try it again.
Jim Lehrer : You have a minute to rebut.
George Bush : Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?
George Bush : That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.
George Bush : (Laughter)
George Bush : Let me help the governor.
George Bush : There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin.
George Bush : When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.
George Bush : John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.
George Bush : Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.
George Bush : It's not going to cost the government money.
George Bush : It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.
George Bush : So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.
George Bush : Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.
George Bush : That happens to be a fact.
George Bush : And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.
George Bush : And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.
Jim Lehrer : Your time is up, too.
Jim Lehrer : A follow-up, John.
John Mashek : Mr. Vice President, you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at the same time you've proposed this capital gains cut, you've proposed more incentive breaks for the oil industry.
John Mashek : You've suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit.
John Mashek : Is the deficit no longer really a concern of yours, the Republican Party or the taxpayers?
George Bush : I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.
George Bush : And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.
George Bush : They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.
George Bush : I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto.
George Bush : He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.
George Bush : I would like a balanced budget amendment.
George Bush : But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.
George Bush : So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.
George Bush : It is that we are continuing to spend too much.
George Bush : So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.
George Bush : Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.
George Bush : And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.
George Bush : And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.
George Bush : Spending was only up something like 4 percent.
George Bush : So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.
George Bush : And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.
George Bush : And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again.
George Bush : Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.
George Bush : A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, you have a minute to rebut.
Michael Dukakis : Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.
Michael Dukakis : What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.
Michael Dukakis : Why that's more than the average teacher makes.
Michael Dukakis : We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.
Michael Dukakis : We've run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.
Michael Dukakis : It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.
Jim Lehrer : All right, the next question will be asked by Anne Groer and it will go the Vice President.
Jim Lehrer : You have two minutes to answer, sir.
Ann Groer : Mr. Vice President, you've said you want a kinder, gentler presidency, one that helps the less fortunate.
Ann Groer : Today, 37 million Americans including many working families with aging parents and young children cannot afford any health insurance, but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.
Ann Groer : What will you do to provide protection for them and how will you pay for it?
George Bush : One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.
George Bush : I want to keep this economic recovery going.
George Bush : More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.
George Bush : What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.
George Bush : I believe that's the answer.
George Bush : I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.
George Bush : And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.
George Bush : But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.
George Bush : So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.
George Bush : "It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""
George Bush : And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.
George Bush : All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.
George Bush : There isn't any such thing as something free out there.
George Bush : It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.
George Bush : So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.
George Bush : I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.
George Bush : I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.
George Bush : It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.
George Bush : But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.
Jim Lehrer : A rebuttal, Governor?
Michael Dukakis : But, George, that's no answer.
George Bush : You don't like the answer, but it's an answer.
Michael Dukakis : Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.
Michael Dukakis : I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens.
Michael Dukakis : All of them with little or no health insurance.
Michael Dukakis : One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance.
Michael Dukakis : Has an 11 year old son and can't let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he's afraid he's going to get hurt and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills.
Michael Dukakis : My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.
Michael Dukakis : The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for those who aren't.
Michael Dukakis : And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.
Michael Dukakis : That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.
Jim Lehrer : Follow-up, Anne?
Ann Groer : Yes.
Ann Groer : Since your Massachusetts health plan has been attacked by the Vice President and you have defended it in this way, I would like to move on to perhaps one of the most costly medical catastrophes facing Americans today and that is AIDS.
Ann Groer : In - at the end of September, the thousands of AIDS patients will lose their access to AZT, which is the only Federally approved drug for treatment of the disease.
Ann Groer : Now, I'd like to now, sir, if - what your position is on extending that and what it is you think the government ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to people who are suffering from this disease.
Michael Dukakis : Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn't know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts.
Michael Dukakis : I hope he hasn't.
Michael Dukakis : Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.
Michael Dukakis : But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine.
Michael Dukakis : The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don't you?
Michael Dukakis : It was in 1964 and that's what he called Medicare.
Michael Dukakis : Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.
Michael Dukakis : (Applause)
Jim Lehrer : If I may interrupt at this point and caution the audience as I did before we went on the air, please hold it down.
Jim Lehrer : You're only taking time away from your candidate when you do that.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, continue, please.
Michael Dukakis : Let me say this about AIDS.
Michael Dukakis : It's the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.
Michael Dukakis : I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.
Michael Dukakis : And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.
Michael Dukakis : But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.
Michael Dukakis : In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.
Michael Dukakis : The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.
Michael Dukakis : I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President, a minute of rebuttal.
George Bush : Well, we're on the right track.
George Bush : The NIH is doing a good job in research.
George Bush : The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education.
George Bush : I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing.
George Bush : But we got to have a knowledge base.
George Bush : Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge.
George Bush : We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.
George Bush : I'm Chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help.
George Bush : And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.
George Bush : We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.
George Bush : So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.
Jim Lehrer : Next question will be asked by Peter Jennings.
Jim Lehrer : It goes to the Governor.
Peter Jennings : Good evening, Mr. Vice President, Governor.
Peter Jennings : Governor, one theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern - you've both mentioned leadership tonight, so I'd like to stay with that for a second.
Peter Jennings : The theme that keeps coming up about the way you govern is passionless, technocratic -
Michael Dukakis : Passionless?
Peter Jennings : Passionless, technocratic, the smartest clerk in the world.
Peter Jennings : Your critics maintain that in the 1960's your public passion was not the war in Vietnam or civil rights, but no fault auto insurance.
Peter Jennings : And they say in the 1970's you played virtually no role in the painful busing crisis in Boston.
Peter Jennings : Given the fact that a president must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion.
Peter Jennings : We need to know if this is a fair portrait of your governing or if it is a stereotype.
Peter Jennings : And if it isn't fair, give us an example of where you have had that passion and leadership that sometimes a president needs?
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President, a rebuttal.
George Bush : Well, I don't question his passion.
George Bush : I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.
George Bush : He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.
George Bush : Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.
George Bush : He - we have a big difference on issues.
George Bush : You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.
George Bush : "He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."
George Bush : "Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU."""
George Bush : That was what he said.
George Bush : He is out there on out of the mainstream.
George Bush : He is very passionate.
George Bush : My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left.
George Bush : And I wish we had time to let me explain.
George Bush : But I salute him for his passion.
George Bush : We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.
George Bush : (Applause)
Jim Lehrer : Peter, a question?
Jim Lehrer : Question for the vice president, Peter.
Peter Jennings : I'd actually like to follow up if I may on this mention you've made of his card carrying membership in the American Civil Liberties Union.
Peter Jennings : "You've used the phrase ""card carrying"" so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of the ACLU that some people have come to believe that you've used it to brand him in some way, to identify him as people were identified in the 1950's as less than patriotic."
Peter Jennings : I'd like to know why you keep repeating the phrase, and what's the important issue here?
Peter Jennings : What is so wrong with the governor being a member of an organization which has come to the defense of, among other people, Colonel Oliver North?
George Bush : Nothings wrong with it.
George Bush : But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.
George Bush : But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.
George Bush : Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here.
George Bush : I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.
George Bush : But I don't agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU.
George Bush : I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.
George Bush : I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.
George Bush : I like those ratings systems.
George Bush : I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.
George Bush : "I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency."
George Bush : Now, these are all positions of the ACLU.
George Bush : And I don't agree with them.
George Bush : He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal.
George Bush : I don't agree with that.
George Bush : I come from a different point.
George Bush : And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.
George Bush : They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.
George Bush : You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.
George Bush : Governor Thompson of Illinois did.
George Bush : I'm not questioning his patriotism.
George Bush : He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism.
George Bush : And then all the liberal columnists join in.
George Bush : I am not.
George Bush : I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.
George Bush : But I believe that's not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years.
George Bush : And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.
George Bush : And I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, a response.
Michael Dukakis : Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.
Michael Dukakis : Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.
Michael Dukakis : I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.
Michael Dukakis : I resent it.
Michael Dukakis : My parents came to this country as immigrants.
Michael Dukakis : They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.
Michael Dukakis : I'm in public service because I love this country.
Michael Dukakis : I believe in it.
Michael Dukakis : And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.
Michael Dukakis : The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one's patriotism--the vice president's been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years.
Michael Dukakis : To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.
Michael Dukakis : (Applause)
Michael Dukakis : Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.
Michael Dukakis : When you're attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it.
Michael Dukakis : I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.
Michael Dukakis : Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight.
Michael Dukakis : Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.
Jim Lehrer : The time is up, governor.
Jim Lehrer : Let's go now to John Mashek, again.
Jim Lehrer : A question for the vice president.
John Mashek : Mr. Vice President, in a debate during the Republican primaries, you said most of the nation's homeless are suffering from mental illness, an assertion immediately challenged by one of your rivals.
John Mashek : Estimates of the homeless range from a low of 250,000 by the government, to around three million, including working families and their children.
John Mashek : What commitment are you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society?
George Bush : I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.
George Bush : I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.
George Bush : I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.
George Bush : The governor's wife has been very active in the homeless.
George Bush : My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife.
George Bush : This isn't government.
George Bush : These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.
George Bush : The government has a role.
George Bush : It is to fully fund the McKinney Act.
George Bush : There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.
George Bush : And so I think that we're on the right track.
George Bush : I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.
George Bush : I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.
George Bush : I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.
George Bush : They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.
George Bush : And we're on the track on this one.
George Bush : But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it.
George Bush : I'd say around 30 percent.
George Bush : And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.
George Bush : Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.
George Bush : Because there is a major problem there.
George Bush : A lot of them are mentally sick.
George Bush : And we've got to attend to them.
George Bush : But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, a response.
Michael Dukakis : Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.
Michael Dukakis : The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.
Michael Dukakis : And when you do that, you've have homeless families.
Michael Dukakis : We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.
Michael Dukakis : We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.
Michael Dukakis : We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.
Michael Dukakis : That's an essential commitment.
Michael Dukakis : And I think the housing community is ready.
Michael Dukakis : But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.
Michael Dukakis : And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.
Michael Dukakis : We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.
Michael Dukakis : This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.
Jim Lehrer : John, a question for the governor.
John Mashek : Governor, you've mentioned the American dream of home ownership, and it's certainly become an impossible one for many of the young people of our nation who are caught up in this economic squeeze of the middle class, as you've said so frequently during the campaign.
John Mashek : And yet in spite of your answer just a few minutes ago, what promise can you realistically hold out to these people that with the costs of housing going up, and with limited help available from Washington, are we destined to become a nation of renters?
Michael Dukakis : Well, I certainly hope not.
Michael Dukakis : And it's all a question of what our priorities are.
Michael Dukakis : Mr. Bush talked about values.
Michael Dukakis : I agree with him.
Michael Dukakis : What are our values?
Michael Dukakis : Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?
Michael Dukakis : I think so.
Michael Dukakis : You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around.
Michael Dukakis : We went out and built housing.
Michael Dukakis : The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.
Michael Dukakis : Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.
Michael Dukakis : This isn't a question of a little charity for the homeless.
Michael Dukakis : This is a question of organizing the housing community.
Michael Dukakis : I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.
Michael Dukakis : Washington, by itself, can't do it all.
Michael Dukakis : We shouldn't expect that.
Michael Dukakis : But governors are ready; mayors are ready.
Michael Dukakis : Builders and community leaders are ready.
Michael Dukakis : It will require some funds, John.
Michael Dukakis : And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.
Michael Dukakis : But that, too, will require some choices.
Michael Dukakis : Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars.
Michael Dukakis : Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?
Michael Dukakis : Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.
Michael Dukakis : Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.
Michael Dukakis : Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.
Michael Dukakis : And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.
Michael Dukakis : We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.
Michael Dukakis : It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.
Jim Lehrer : A response, Mr. Vice President.
George Bush : I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.
George Bush : Let's talk about housing which the question was.
George Bush : When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?
George Bush : Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent.
George Bush : Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?
George Bush : Housing is up.
George Bush : We are serving a million more families now.
George Bush : But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.
George Bush : Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort.
George Bush : It is wrong.
George Bush : I favor home ownership.
George Bush : I want to see more vouchers.
George Bush : I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.
George Bush : They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.
George Bush : But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.
Jim Lehrer : All right, the next question is to the governor.
Jim Lehrer : Ann Groer will ask it.
Ann Groer : Governor Dukakis, is there a conflict between your opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on demand, even though in the minds of many people, that's also killing?
Michael Dukakis : No, I don't think there is.
Michael Dukakis : There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.
Michael Dukakis : I'm opposed to the death penalty.
Michael Dukakis : I think everybody knows that.
Michael Dukakis : I'm also very tough on violent crime.
Michael Dukakis : And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.
Michael Dukakis : It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.
Michael Dukakis : It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.
Michael Dukakis : You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.
Michael Dukakis : The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.
Michael Dukakis : I don't favor abortion.
Michael Dukakis : I don't think it's a good thing.
Michael Dukakis : I don't think most people do.
Michael Dukakis : The question is who makes the decision.
Michael Dukakis : And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.
Jim Lehrer : Response, Mr. Vice President.
George Bush : Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.
George Bush : It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.
George Bush : The federal program doesn't do that.
George Bush : No other state programs do that.
George Bush : And I favor the death penalty.
George Bush : I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.
George Bush : But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.
George Bush : And I do believe it would be inhibiting.
George Bush : And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.
George Bush : Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.
George Bush : And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.
George Bush : And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.
George Bush : I favor adoption.
George Bush : I do not favor abortion.
Jim Lehrer : Question for the vice president, Ann?
Ann Groer : Yes.
Ann Groer : Mr. Vice President, I'd like to stay with abortion for just a moment if I might.
Ann Groer : Over the years you have expressed several positions, while opposing nearly all forms of government payment for it.
Ann Groer : You now say that you support abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or threat to a mother's life, and you also support a constitutional amendment that if ratified would outlaw most abortions.
Ann Groer : But if abortions were to become illegal again, do you think that the women who defy the law and have them anyway, as they did before it was okayed by the Supreme Court, and the doctors who perform them should go to jail?
George Bush : I haven't sorted out the penalties.
George Bush : But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.
George Bush : And I favor adoption.
George Bush : And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.
George Bush : And you see, yes, my position has evolved.
George Bush : And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.
George Bush : And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.
George Bush : Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.
George Bush : As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.
George Bush : See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion.
George Bush : We certainly do.
George Bush : But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.
Jim Lehrer : Governor.
Michael Dukakis : Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.
Michael Dukakis : It's as simple as that.
Michael Dukakis : I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.
Michael Dukakis : This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.
Michael Dukakis : And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.
George Bush : I just -
Michael Dukakis : Let me finish.
Michael Dukakis : Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.
Michael Dukakis : I respect his right to disagree with me.
Michael Dukakis : But I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.
Jim Lehrer : Peter Jennings, a question for the vice president.
Peter Jennings : Mr. Vice President, I'm struck by your discussion of women and the sanctity of life.
Peter Jennings : And it leads me to recall your own phrase, that you are haunted by the lives which children in our inner cities live.
Peter Jennings : Certainly the evidence is compelling.
Peter Jennings : There's an explosion of single parent families.
Peter Jennings : And by any measure, these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school drop outs, crime, which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control.
Peter Jennings : If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan-Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut?
George Bush : One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.
George Bush : But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.
George Bush : That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.
George Bush : I do strongly support the WIC program.
George Bush : I think it is good.
George Bush : I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.
George Bush : But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.
George Bush : The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.
George Bush : I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.
George Bush : I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.
George Bush : And so it's a combination of these things.
George Bush : But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.
George Bush : The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.
George Bush : I'm for Head Start and moving that up.
George Bush : And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.
George Bush : But I favor that.
George Bush : So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.
Jim Lehrer : Governor.
Michael Dukakis : Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.
Michael Dukakis : It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.
Michael Dukakis : And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.
Michael Dukakis : Let me just give you one other example.
Michael Dukakis : We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.
Michael Dukakis : The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.
Michael Dukakis : It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.
Michael Dukakis : That's the way you help people.
Michael Dukakis : Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.
Michael Dukakis : I know what strong political leadership is.
Michael Dukakis : I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.
Michael Dukakis : These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.
Jim Lehrer : A question for the governor, Peter.
Peter Jennings : Governor, the crisis is no less a crisis for you if you are elected president.
Peter Jennings : Where would you get the money to devote to the inner cities which is clearly needed.
Peter Jennings : And can you be specific about the programs not only you'd reinstate, but the more imaginative ones that you'd begin.
Michael Dukakis : Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.
Michael Dukakis : Welfare reform is one way to do it.
Michael Dukakis : If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.
Michael Dukakis : That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.
Michael Dukakis : In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.
Michael Dukakis : One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.
Michael Dukakis : Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.
Michael Dukakis : And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.
Michael Dukakis : So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.
Michael Dukakis : Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.
Michael Dukakis : I know the private sector is.
Michael Dukakis : People are all over the country.
Michael Dukakis : But it takes presidential leadership.
Michael Dukakis : It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.
Michael Dukakis : And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President.
George Bush : What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't understand what I'm talking about.
George Bush : This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.
George Bush : They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.
George Bush : The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.
George Bush : It is not down.
George Bush : But here's the point he misses.
George Bush : The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.
George Bush : But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better.
George Bush : We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.
George Bush : We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.
George Bush : And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.
George Bush : And we can do it.
George Bush : But itâĴs not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.
Jim Lehrer : All right, let's move now to some questions on foreign and national security policy.
Jim Lehrer : John Mashek will ask the first question of the governor.
John Mashek : Governor, the vice president continually refers to your lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and national security matters.
John Mashek : He says you are prepared to eliminate weapons system that will result in the unilateral disarmament of this country.
John Mashek : Is that true?
Michael Dukakis : Of course not.
Michael Dukakis : Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.
Michael Dukakis : I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.
Michael Dukakis : Remember that, George?
Michael Dukakis : And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.
Michael Dukakis : Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.
Michael Dukakis : It's not the length of your resume.
Michael Dukakis : It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.
Michael Dukakis : It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.
Michael Dukakis : The vice president has a long resume.
Michael Dukakis : But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.
Michael Dukakis : And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.
Michael Dukakis : His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.
Michael Dukakis : He went to Philippines in the early 80âĴs and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.
Michael Dukakis : And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.
Michael Dukakis : So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.
Michael Dukakis : The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.
Michael Dukakis : I'm ready to provide that leadership.
Michael Dukakis : I want to be the commander in chief of this country.
Michael Dukakis : I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.
Michael Dukakis : But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.
Michael Dukakis : It's strength; it's values.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President.
George Bush : Well, I thought the question was about defense.
George Bush : The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.
George Bush : And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.
George Bush : Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability.
George Bush : That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.
George Bush : I've met Mr. Gorbachev.
George Bush : Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day.
George Bush : These people are tough.
George Bush : But now we have a chance.
George Bush : I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.
George Bush : And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.
George Bush : As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more.
George Bush : It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.
George Bush : But I'll tell you what I was thinking of.
George Bush : I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila.
George Bush : And he was down there fighting against imperialism.
George Bush : And he had just-
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President
George Bush : And he just lifted martial law.
George Bush : And he just called for new elections.
George Bush : And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.
George Bush : And out he goes.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President, your time is up.
Jim Lehrer : John, a question for the vice president.
John Mashek : Mr. Vice President, the governor has suggested that you've never met a weapons system that you didn't like or want.
John Mashek : Are you prepared to tell the voters one system in this time of tight budgetary restraints and problems at the Pentagon that you'd be willing to cut or even eliminate that wouldn't endanger national security?
George Bush : I don't think it's a question of eliminating.
George Bush : I can tell him some I'm against.
George Bush : A-6F, for example.
George Bush : DIVAD.
George Bush : And I can go on and on.
George Bush : Minuteman III, penetration systems.
George Bush : I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.
George Bush : I'm simply not going to do that.
George Bush : And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.
George Bush : We're going to have to-the MX.
George Bush : We're going to have to do that.
George Bush : It's Christmas.
George Bush : (Laughter)
George Bush : Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?
Michael Dukakis : I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.
George Bush : wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?
George Bush : These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.
George Bush : Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.
George Bush : But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.
George Bush : We will do what we do best.
George Bush : It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.
George Bush : It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.
George Bush : But look, let me sum it up.
George Bush : I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.
George Bush : I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.
George Bush : But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.
George Bush : And I think I've had that.
Jim Lehrer : Governor?
Michael Dukakis : Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today.
Michael Dukakis : As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.
Michael Dukakis : I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.
Michael Dukakis : But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.
Michael Dukakis : We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.
Michael Dukakis : Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars.
Michael Dukakis : He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don't need and can't afford.
Michael Dukakis : I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.
Michael Dukakis : I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.
Michael Dukakis : But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.
Michael Dukakis : I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.
Michael Dukakis : But I don't think we need these other systems.
Michael Dukakis : I don't think we need them to remain strong.
Michael Dukakis : We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.
Jim Lehrer : Anne Groer, a question for the Vice President.
Ann Groer : Well, Mr. Vice President, you said you've met with Secretary General Gorbachev, you've met with Mr. Shevardnadze, but for the last forty years Americans have been taught to regard the Soviet Union as the enemy.
Ann Groer : Yet, President Reagan has signed two arms control treaties and he's promised to share Star Wars technology with the very country he once called the evil empire.
Ann Groer : So, perhaps you can tell us this evening, should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long regarded as an adversary?
George Bush : What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.
George Bush : Be cautious.
George Bush : Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.
George Bush : Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.
George Bush : And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.
George Bush : And when they have a --they a --deals that are good for us, as China started to do--the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature.
George Bush : And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.
George Bush : We should encourage that.
George Bush : We ought to say this is good.
George Bush : But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.
George Bush : I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.
George Bush : And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.
George Bush : You see the turmoil in Poland today.
George Bush : And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.
George Bush : I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets.
George Bush : We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.
George Bush : But this is an exciting time.
George Bush : But all I'm suggesting is let's not be naÂŻve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.
George Bush : Look at the INF treaty.
George Bush : And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn.
George Bush : The freeze people were wrong.
George Bush : The Reagan-Bush administration was right.
Jim Lehrer : Governor Dukakis.
Michael Dukakis : It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.
Michael Dukakis : And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery.
Michael Dukakis : Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.
Michael Dukakis : What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.
Michael Dukakis : Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.
Michael Dukakis : And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.
Michael Dukakis : We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.
Michael Dukakis : We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about.
Michael Dukakis : But there are opportunities there now.
Michael Dukakis : Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990âĴs and beyond.
Michael Dukakis : Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.
Michael Dukakis : And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home.
Michael Dukakis : Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.
Michael Dukakis : We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.
Michael Dukakis : That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.
Michael Dukakis : (Applause)
Jim Lehrer : Anne Groer, a question for the Governor.
Ann Groer : Yes.
Ann Groer : Governor Dukakis, speaking of seeming changes of position, you have gone from calling the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, a fantasy and a fraud, to saying recently that you would continue SDI research and might even deploy the system if Congress supported such a move.
Ann Groer : Why the change of heart?
Michael Dukakis : No, there's been no change of heart.
Michael Dukakis : I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year.
Michael Dukakis : But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.
Michael Dukakis : It makes real sense.
Michael Dukakis : And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.
Michael Dukakis : So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.
Michael Dukakis : Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, ˘â°ÂWell, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.˘â°Â¤ He hasn't told us where.
Michael Dukakis : We know where they're cutting.
Michael Dukakis : We know where you're cutting right now.
Michael Dukakis : You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.
Michael Dukakis : You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment.
Michael Dukakis : An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.
Michael Dukakis : Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.
Michael Dukakis : They're supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don't have enough fuel.
Michael Dukakis : You have to make choices.
Michael Dukakis : We're not making those choices.
Michael Dukakis : And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.
Michael Dukakis : We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.
Michael Dukakis : We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.
Michael Dukakis : They have about 12,000.
Michael Dukakis : So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.
Michael Dukakis : But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.
Michael Dukakis : That's-at least that's what I read.
Michael Dukakis : Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President.
George Bush : I'm not reconsidering my position.
George Bush : Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.
George Bush : Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.
George Bush : He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.
George Bush : The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.
George Bush : Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.
George Bush : And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.
George Bush : (Applause)
George Bush : He's got to get this thing more clear.
George Bush : Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud?
George Bush : I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.
George Bush : We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.
George Bush : That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.
Jim Lehrer : Peter Jennings, a question for Governor Dukakis.
Peter Jennings : Well, Governor, and Vice President Bush, you've both talked tonight about hard choices.
Peter Jennings : Let me try to give you one.
Peter Jennings : Somewhere in the Middle East tonight, nine Americans are being held hostage.
Peter Jennings : If you are commander-in-chief and Americans are held hostage, what will be more important to you, their individual fate, or the commitment that the United States Government must never negotiate with terrorists.
Peter Jennings : And if any Americans are held hostage and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them?
Michael Dukakis : Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.
Michael Dukakis : These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.
Michael Dukakis : Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.
Michael Dukakis : But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.
Michael Dukakis : Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.
Michael Dukakis : And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.
Michael Dukakis : As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.
Michael Dukakis : And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.
Michael Dukakis : So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same.
Michael Dukakis : We've got to be tough on international terrorism.
Michael Dukakis : We've got to treat it as international crime.
Michael Dukakis : We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.
Michael Dukakis : We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.
Michael Dukakis : Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.
Michael Dukakis : That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President?
George Bush : I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.
George Bush : It is the best anti-terrorist report written.
George Bush : Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.
George Bush : But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.
George Bush : Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.
George Bush : And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.
Michael Dukakis : That's not true.
Michael Dukakis : That's not true.
George Bush : And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.
Michael Dukakis : That's not true.
George Bush : And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter.
George Bush : And I've said mistakes were made.
George Bush : Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.
George Bush : That is a very serious charge against the president.
George Bush : The matter has been thoroughly looked into.
George Bush : But the point is sometimes the action-
George Bush : (Laughter)
George Bush : - has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response.
Jim Lehrer : A question for the Vice President.
Jim Lehrer : Peter?
Peter Jennings : It seems perhaps a good subject, Mr. Vice President, on which to make the point that you've campaigned vigorously as part of a leadership team.
Peter Jennings : But so far you won't tell the American people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president, including the sale of arms to Iran and what should have been done about the hostages.
Peter Jennings : To the best of my knowledge there's no Constitutional requirement which prevents you from doing so.
Peter Jennings : Jimmy Carter urged his Vice President, Walter Mondale, to tell the American people.
Peter Jennings : Would you now ask President Reagan for permission to tell the American people what advice you did give him?
Peter Jennings : And if you don't, how do we judge your judgment in the Oval Office in the last eight years?
George Bush : You're judged by the whole record.
George Bush : You're judged by the entire record.
George Bush : Are we closer to peace?
George Bush : Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?
George Bush : Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there?
George Bush : How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.
George Bush : Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?
George Bush : You judge on the record.
George Bush : Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan?
George Bush : How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians don't like it, but the rest of the country will understand.
George Bush : (Applause)
George Bush : Now we have a chance.
George Bush : Now we have a chance.
George Bush : And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.
George Bush : And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.
George Bush : Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.
George Bush : He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.
George Bush : (Applause)
George Bush : I still have a couple of minutes left.
George Bush : And there is a difference principle -
Jim Lehrer : Sorry, Mr. Vice President.
George Bush : It's only on yellow here.
George Bush : Wait a minute.
George Bush : (Laughter)
Jim Lehrer : I'm wrong.
Jim Lehrer : Go ahead.
Jim Lehrer : My apologies.
George Bush : Jim -
Jim Lehrer : You said nobody's perfect.
George Bush : I said I wasn't perfect.
George Bush : Where was I?
Michael Dukakis : 25th of December, Mr. Vice President.
Michael Dukakis : (Laughter)
George Bush : I finished.
Michael Dukakis : He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, you have a minute to respond.
Michael Dukakis : Well, the matter of judgment is very important.
Michael Dukakis : And I think it's important to understand what happened here.
Michael Dukakis : A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.
Michael Dukakis : They were ignored.
Michael Dukakis : The Vice President ignored them.
Michael Dukakis : He says mistakes were made.
Michael Dukakis : Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.
Michael Dukakis : He says, ˘â°ÂWell, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.
Michael Dukakis : Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.˘â°Â¤
Michael Dukakis : I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review.
Michael Dukakis : We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.
Michael Dukakis : You cannot make concessions to terrorists.
Michael Dukakis : If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.
Michael Dukakis : That's a basic principle.
Michael Dukakis : It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.
Jim Lehrer : A question from John Mashek.
Jim Lehrer : It goes to the Vice President.
John Mashek : Mr. Vice President, Democrats and even some Republicans are still expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, your chosen running mate, to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.
John Mashek : What do you see in him that others do not?
John Mashek : (Laughter)
George Bush : I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice.
George Bush : I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30âĴs and 40âĴs.
George Bush : I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we're in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit-for a-work that will be productive and he won't have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal-talking about.
George Bush : I see a young man who is a knowledgeable-in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable-in the whole-in the race-knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them.
George Bush : And I believe that he will be outstanding.
George Bush : And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.
George Bush : And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.
George Bush : And he's kept his head up.
George Bush : And he will do very very well.
George Bush : And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30âĴs and 40âĴs and more.
George Bush : So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.
George Bush : My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.
George Bush : Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.
George Bush : And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.
George Bush : (Applause)
Michael Dukakis : Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.
Michael Dukakis : I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.
Michael Dukakis : (Applause)
George Bush : Just the facts.
Michael Dukakis : But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?
George Bush : No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.
Michael Dukakis : I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.
Michael Dukakis : I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned.
Michael Dukakis : Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.
Michael Dukakis : I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.
Michael Dukakis : And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.
Jim Lehrer : John will ask a question of the Governor.
Jim Lehrer : It will be the last question and then the Vice President will have a rebuttal.
John Mashek : Well, Governor, you did select Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
Michael Dukakis : I did indeed.
John Mashek : And you have a lot of disagreement with him on fundamental issues, including the Reagan tax cuts, aid to the rebels in Nicaragua, the death penalty, gun control.
John Mashek : Who's right?
John Mashek : (Laughter)
Michael Dukakis : Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years.
Michael Dukakis : I've picked a lot of people.
Michael Dukakis : I've picked cabinets.
Michael Dukakis : I've named judges.
Michael Dukakis : I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.
Michael Dukakis : I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.
Michael Dukakis : But I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis.
Michael Dukakis : I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President.
Michael Dukakis : Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, ˘â°ÂMr.
Michael Dukakis : President, that's wrong.
Michael Dukakis : We shouldn't do that.˘â°Â¤ That's the kind of Vice President I want.
Michael Dukakis : He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.
Michael Dukakis : When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.
Michael Dukakis : And I'm very very proud of that choice.
Michael Dukakis : And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.
Michael Dukakis : You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking.
Michael Dukakis : The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.
Michael Dukakis : I doubt very much.
Michael Dukakis : I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.
Michael Dukakis : (Applause)
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President?
George Bush : Well, I-we obviously have a difference.
George Bush : I believe it does meet the test.
George Bush : We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.
George Bush : (Laughter)
George Bush : I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening.
George Bush : I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.
George Bush : But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.
George Bush : But you talk about judgment.
George Bush : I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.
George Bush : What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts?
George Bush : I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.
George Bush : But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he'll do an outstanding job.
Jim Lehrer : Gentlemen, I was given some bad word a moment ago.
Jim Lehrer : There is time for one more question.
Jim Lehrer : Getting it in my ear and Ann Groer will ask it.
Jim Lehrer : Ann?
Jim Lehrer : To the Governor.
Ann Groer : Governor Dukakis, as many U.S. farmers face or undergo foreclosure, the United States is considering the possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin American and Third World countries, do you favor giving these countries a break in their loans and, if so, how do you explain that to the American farmers who are losing their land and livelihood?
Michael Dukakis : Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.
Michael Dukakis : And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.
Michael Dukakis : But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.
Michael Dukakis : I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies.
Michael Dukakis : And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.
Michael Dukakis : I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.
Michael Dukakis : Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.
Michael Dukakis : I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.
Michael Dukakis : But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.
Michael Dukakis : As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President?
George Bush : I oppose supply management and production controls.
George Bush : I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.
George Bush : I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.
George Bush : I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.
George Bush : I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.
George Bush : In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.
George Bush : I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.
George Bush : And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.
George Bush : I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.
George Bush : But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.
George Bush : Let's try to expand our markets abroad.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : That really is the end.
Jim Lehrer : Now, let's go to closing statements.
Jim Lehrer : They will be two minutes each in duration by agreement.
Jim Lehrer : Vice President Bush goes first.
Jim Lehrer : Governor Dukakis second.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Vice President.
George Bush : I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country.
George Bush : But there are two main focal points of this election.
George Bush : Opportunity and peace.
George Bush : I want to keep this expansion going.
George Bush : Yes, we want change but we are the change.
George Bush : I am the change.
George Bush : I don't want to go back to malaise and misery index.
George Bush : And, so, opportunity.
George Bush : Keep America at work.
George Bush : The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.
George Bush : And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.
George Bush : We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it.
George Bush : I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.
George Bush : I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.
George Bush : And then it gets down to a question of values.
George Bush : We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.
George Bush : And I do favor the death penalty.
George Bush : And we've got a wide array of differences on those.
George Bush : But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they're going to say, ˘â°ÂWho has the values I believe in?
George Bush : Who has the experience that we trust?
George Bush : Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?˘â°Â¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support.
George Bush : Thank you very much.
George Bush : (Applause)
Michael Dukakis : This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.
Michael Dukakis : We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you.
Michael Dukakis : I'm more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country.
Michael Dukakis : You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream.
Michael Dukakis : They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.
Michael Dukakis : I believe in the American dream.
Michael Dukakis : I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country.
Michael Dukakis : With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America.
Michael Dukakis : With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.
Michael Dukakis : Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itâĴs not an insolvable problem.
Michael Dukakis : It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.
Michael Dukakis : We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide.
Michael Dukakis : We compete.
Michael Dukakis : The best America.
