Bob Schieffer : Good evening from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona.
Bob Schieffer : I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News.
Bob Schieffer : I want to welcome you to the third and last of the 2004 debates between President George Bush and Senator John Kerry.
Bob Schieffer : As Jim Lehrer told you before the first one, these debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
Bob Schieffer : Tonight the topic will be domestic affairs, but the format will be the same as that first debate.
Bob Schieffer : I'll moderate our discussion under detailed rules agreed to by the candidates, but the questions and the areas to be covered were chosen by me.
Bob Schieffer : I have not told the candidates or anyone else what they are.
Bob Schieffer : To refresh your memory on the rules, I will ask a question.
Bob Schieffer : The candidate is allowed two minutes to answer.
Bob Schieffer : His opponent then has a minute and a half to offer a rebuttal.
Bob Schieffer : At my discretion, I can extend the discussion by offering each candidate an additional 30 seconds.
Bob Schieffer : A green light will come on to signal the candidate has 30 seconds left.
Bob Schieffer : A yellow light signals 15 seconds left.
Bob Schieffer : A red light means five seconds left.
Bob Schieffer : There is also a buzzer, if it is needed.
Bob Schieffer : The candidates may not question each other directly.
Bob Schieffer : There are no opening statements, but there will be two-minute closing statements.
Bob Schieffer : There is an audience here tonight, but they have agreed to remain silent, except for right now, when they join me in welcoming President George Bush and Senator John Kerry.
Bob Schieffer : (APPLAUSE)
Bob Schieffer : Gentlemen, welcome to you both.
Bob Schieffer : By coin toss, the first question goes to Senator Kerry.
Bob Schieffer : Senator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight.
Bob Schieffer : And that is, will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up?
John Kerry : Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight.
John Kerry : Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.
John Kerry : And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task.
John Kerry : We're proud to be here.
John Kerry : Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.
John Kerry : Will we ever be safe and secure again?
John Kerry : Yes.
John Kerry : We absolutely must be.
John Kerry : That's the goal.
John Kerry : Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.
John Kerry : I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away.
John Kerry : And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.
John Kerry : The measurement is not: Are we safer?
John Kerry : The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?
John Kerry : And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected.
John Kerry : Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected.
John Kerry : That's not good enough.
John Kerry : People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is.
John Kerry : That's not good enough.
John Kerry : Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.
John Kerry : Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.
John Kerry : So we can do a better job of homeland security.
John Kerry : I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.
John Kerry : I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.
John Kerry : We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.
John Kerry : But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President, you have 90 seconds.
George W. Bush : Bob, thank you very much.
George W. Bush : I want to thank Arizona State as well.
George W. Bush : Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.
George W. Bush : I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.
George W. Bush : As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend.
George W. Bush : And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman.
George W. Bush : Think about that.
George W. Bush : Freedom is on the march.
George W. Bush : We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.
George W. Bush : In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.
George W. Bush : My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.
George W. Bush : I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.
George W. Bush : I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.
George W. Bush : At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.
George W. Bush : I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources.
George W. Bush : My opponent voted against it.
George W. Bush : We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.
George W. Bush : But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.
George W. Bush : It just takes good, strong leadership.
Bob Schieffer : Anything to add, Senator Kerry?
John Kerry : Yes.
John Kerry : When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.
John Kerry : "Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """
John Kerry : "He said, ""I don't know."
John Kerry : I don't really think about him very much.
John Kerry : "I'm not that concerned. """
John Kerry : We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden.
George W. Bush : It's kind of one of those exaggerations.
George W. Bush : Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.
George W. Bush : We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.
George W. Bush : We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.
George W. Bush : My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement.
George W. Bush : No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.
Bob Schieffer : New question, Mr. President, to you.
Bob Schieffer : We are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us.
Bob Schieffer : Flu kills thousands of people every year.
Bob Schieffer : Suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine.
Bob Schieffer : How did that happen?
George W. Bush : Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.
George W. Bush : And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.
George W. Bush : We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.
George W. Bush : My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year.
George W. Bush : Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.
George W. Bush : The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.
George W. Bush : I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.
George W. Bush : We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America.
George W. Bush : Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.
George W. Bush : One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.
George W. Bush : But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry?
John Kerry : This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system.
John Kerry : It's not working for the American family.
John Kerry : And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.
John Kerry : Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.
John Kerry : You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all.
John Kerry : 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch.
John Kerry : 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.
John Kerry : All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.
John Kerry : This president has turned his back on the wellness of America.
John Kerry : And there is no system.
John Kerry : In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.
John Kerry : Children across our country don't have health care.
John Kerry : We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.
John Kerry : I have a plan to cover all Americans.
John Kerry : We're going to make it affordable and accessible.
John Kerry : We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President, would you like to add something?
George W. Bush : I would.
George W. Bush : Thank you.
George W. Bush : I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.
George W. Bush : He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get.
George W. Bush : That costs the government $7,700 per family.
George W. Bush : If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.
George W. Bush : It's an empty promise.
George W. Bush : It's called bait and switch.
Bob Schieffer : Time's up.
George W. Bush : Thank you.
John Kerry : Actually, it's not an empty promise.
John Kerry : It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan.
John Kerry : He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.
John Kerry : What we do is we have choice.
John Kerry : I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield.
John Kerry : Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.
John Kerry : But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.
John Kerry : Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.
John Kerry : We're not giving this away for nothing.
Bob Schieffer : All right.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry, a new question.
Bob Schieffer : Let's talk about economic security.
Bob Schieffer : You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year.
Bob Schieffer : But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it.
Bob Schieffer : Health-care costs, as you are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.
Bob Schieffer : My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?
John Kerry : I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.
John Kerry : During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules.
John Kerry : If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.
John Kerry : President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.
John Kerry : He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.
John Kerry : He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.
John Kerry : Now, I'm going to reverse that.
John Kerry : I'm going to change that.
John Kerry : We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.
John Kerry : Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.
John Kerry : And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.
John Kerry : We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.
John Kerry : They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.
John Kerry : I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker.
John Kerry : And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound.
John Kerry : I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.
John Kerry : I have a manufacturing jobs credit.
John Kerry : We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas.
John Kerry : We raise the student loans.
John Kerry : I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.
John Kerry : This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.
George W. Bush : He been a senator for 20 years.
George W. Bush : He voted to increase taxes 98 times.
George W. Bush : When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.
George W. Bush : He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.
George W. Bush : He talks about PAYGO.
George W. Bush : I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.
George W. Bush : He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.
George W. Bush : There is a tax gap.
George W. Bush : And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?
George W. Bush : The middle class.
George W. Bush : I propose a detailed budget, Bob.
George W. Bush : I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.
George W. Bush : It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.
Bob Schieffer : Let's go to a new question, Mr. President.
Bob Schieffer : Two minutes.
Bob Schieffer : And let's continue on jobs.
Bob Schieffer : You know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States?
George W. Bush : I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century.
George W. Bush : And here's some help for you to go get an education.
George W. Bush : Here's some help for you to go to a community college.
George W. Bush : We've expanded trade adjustment assistance.
George W. Bush : We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.
George W. Bush : You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing.
George W. Bush : We talk about fiscal matters.
George W. Bush : But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.
George W. Bush : I went to Washington to solve problems.
George W. Bush : And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.
George W. Bush : They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.
George W. Bush : And so we said: Let's raise the standards.
George W. Bush : We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.
George W. Bush : No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job.
George W. Bush : Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.
George W. Bush : Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.
George W. Bush : And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.
George W. Bush : And that's what I would say to that person.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry?
John Kerry : I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.
John Kerry : Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.
John Kerry : Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.
John Kerry : (LAUGHTER)
John Kerry : This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.
John Kerry : Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.
John Kerry : But guess what, America?
John Kerry : The wages of Americans have gone down.
John Kerry : The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.
John Kerry : And the president just walks on by this problem.
John Kerry : The fact is that he's cut job-training money.
John Kerry : $1 billion was cut.
John Kerry : They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.
John Kerry : They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.
John Kerry : They've cut the training money.
John Kerry : They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.
John Kerry : I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.
Bob Schieffer : New question to you, Senator Kerry, two minutes.
Bob Schieffer : And it's still on jobs.
Bob Schieffer : You know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs.
Bob Schieffer : For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress.
Bob Schieffer : That's not the president's fault.
Bob Schieffer : So I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs?
John Kerry : I don't blame them entirely for it.
John Kerry : I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.
John Kerry : Outsourcing is going to happen.
John Kerry : I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country.
John Kerry : "I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?"
John Kerry : """And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """
John Kerry : What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.
John Kerry : Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.
John Kerry : You get to defer your taxes.
John Kerry : "So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. """
John Kerry : That's not smart.
John Kerry : I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.
John Kerry : And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.
John Kerry : And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.
John Kerry : The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field.
John Kerry : This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.
John Kerry : He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.
John Kerry : The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation.
John Kerry : There are companies that wanted to petition the administration.
John Kerry : They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.
John Kerry : The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.
John Kerry : I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker.
John Kerry : And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job.
John Kerry : That's what the American worker wants.
John Kerry : And if we do that, we can have an impact.
John Kerry : Plus, we need fiscal discipline.
John Kerry : Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : Whew!
George W. Bush : Let me start with the Pell Grants.
George W. Bush : In his last litany of misstatements.
George W. Bush : He said we cut Pell Grants.
George W. Bush : We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.
George W. Bush : That's a fact.
George W. Bush : You know, he talks to the workers.
George W. Bush : Let me talk to the workers.
George W. Bush : You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.
George W. Bush : If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit.
George W. Bush : That's money in your pocket.
George W. Bush : If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.
George W. Bush : The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.
George W. Bush : We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.
George W. Bush : A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.
George W. Bush : It's your money.
George W. Bush : "The way my opponent talks, he said, ""We're going to spend the government's money."
George W. Bush : """No, we're spending your money."
George W. Bush : And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.
George W. Bush : I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.
George W. Bush : My opponent talks about fiscal sanity.
George W. Bush : His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.
George W. Bush : He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry?
John Kerry : Bob, anybody can play with these votes.
John Kerry : Everybody knows that.
John Kerry : I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times.
John Kerry : I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for.
John Kerry : I voted for IRA tax cuts.
John Kerry : I voted for small-business tax cuts.
John Kerry : But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers?
John Kerry : Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.
John Kerry : But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them.
John Kerry : They're getting less money.
John Kerry : We have more people who qualify.
John Kerry : That's not what we want.
George W. Bush : Senator, no one's playing with your votes.
George W. Bush : You voted to increase taxes 98 times.
George W. Bush : When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.
George W. Bush : He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times.
George W. Bush : You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank.
George W. Bush : As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues.
Bob Schieffer : But let's shift to some other questions here.
Bob Schieffer : Both of you are opposed to gay marriage.
Bob Schieffer : But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question.
Bob Schieffer : Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?
George W. Bush : You know, Bob, I don't know.
George W. Bush : I just don't know.
George W. Bush : I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.
George W. Bush : It's important that we do that.
George W. Bush : And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.
George W. Bush : And that's to be honored.
George W. Bush : But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.
George W. Bush : I believe in the sanctity of marriage.
George W. Bush : I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.
George W. Bush : I proposed a constitutional amendment.
George W. Bush : The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.
George W. Bush : It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process.
George W. Bush : After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.
George W. Bush : I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.
George W. Bush : You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.
George W. Bush : My opponent was against it.
George W. Bush : It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.
George W. Bush : It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.
George W. Bush : But I'm concerned that that will get overturned.
George W. Bush : And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry?
John Kerry : We're all God's children, Bob.
John Kerry : And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.
John Kerry : I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice.
John Kerry : I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.
John Kerry : And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.
John Kerry : I think we have to respect that.
John Kerry : The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.
John Kerry : I believe that.
John Kerry : I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.
John Kerry : But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace.
John Kerry : You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.
John Kerry : You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital.
John Kerry : You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.
John Kerry : Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws.
John Kerry : And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry, a new question for you.
Bob Schieffer : The New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research.
Bob Schieffer : What is your reaction to that?
John Kerry : I respect their views.
John Kerry : I completely respect their views.
John Kerry : I am a Catholic.
John Kerry : And I grew up learning how to respect those views.
John Kerry : But I disagree with them, as do many.
John Kerry : I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith.
John Kerry : What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.
John Kerry : I believe that choice is a woman's choice.
John Kerry : It's between a woman, God and her doctor.
John Kerry : And that's why I support that.
John Kerry : Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.
John Kerry : The president has never said whether or not he would do that.
John Kerry : But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.
John Kerry : I will not.
John Kerry : I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.
John Kerry : Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.
John Kerry : I was an altar boy.
John Kerry : I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.
John Kerry : "And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."
John Kerry : "I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """
John Kerry : My faith affects everything that I do, in truth.
John Kerry : "There's a great passage of the Bible that says, ""What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds?"
John Kerry : "Faith without works is dead. """
John Kerry : And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.
John Kerry : That's why I fight against poverty.
John Kerry : That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.
John Kerry : That's why I fight for equality and justice.
John Kerry : All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.
John Kerry : But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.
John Kerry : And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : I think it's important to promote a culture of life.
George W. Bush : I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.
George W. Bush : I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life.
George W. Bush : I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.
George W. Bush : Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.
George W. Bush : It's a brutal practice.
George W. Bush : People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.
George W. Bush : It made a lot of sense.
George W. Bush : My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.
George W. Bush : What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.
George W. Bush : The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.
George W. Bush : That's great.
George W. Bush : I appreciate that very much.
George W. Bush : All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President, let's have a new question.
Bob Schieffer : It goes to you.
Bob Schieffer : And let's get back to economic issues.
Bob Schieffer : Health insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last four years according to The Washington Post.
Bob Schieffer : We're paying more.
Bob Schieffer : We're getting less.
Bob Schieffer : I would like to ask you: Who bears responsibility for this?
Bob Schieffer : Is it the government?
Bob Schieffer : Is it the insurance companies?
Bob Schieffer : Is it the lawyers?
Bob Schieffer : Is it the doctors?
Bob Schieffer : Is it the administration?
George W. Bush : Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration.
George W. Bush : There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem.
George W. Bush : Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process.
George W. Bush : Most health-care costs are covered by third parties.
George W. Bush : And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.
George W. Bush : And there's no market forces involved with health care.
George W. Bush : It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.
George W. Bush : These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.
George W. Bush : Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis.
George W. Bush : But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care.
George W. Bush : Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America.
George W. Bush : That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.
George W. Bush : In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent.
George W. Bush : Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.
George W. Bush : Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology.
George W. Bush : It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.
George W. Bush : And so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care.
George W. Bush : We're beginning to do it.
George W. Bush : We're changing the language.
George W. Bush : We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.
George W. Bush : People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.
George W. Bush : And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker.
George W. Bush : And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry?
John Kerry : The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.
John Kerry : Let me give you a prime example.
John Kerry : In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada.
John Kerry : But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right.
John Kerry : The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada.
John Kerry : We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing.
John Kerry : The VA does that.
John Kerry : The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.
John Kerry : We could have done that in Medicare.
John Kerry : Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer.
John Kerry : Medicare belongs to you.
John Kerry : Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.
John Kerry : But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.
John Kerry : Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets.
John Kerry : That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.
John Kerry : When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.
John Kerry : Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.
John Kerry : So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.
John Kerry : We got to have health care for all Americans.
Bob Schieffer : Go ahead, Mr. President.
George W. Bush : I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United States Senate for 20 years?
George W. Bush : He has no record on reforming of health care.
George W. Bush : No record at all.
George W. Bush : He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five.
George W. Bush : No record of leadership.
George W. Bush : I came to Washington to solve problems.
George W. Bush : I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.
George W. Bush : And so I led.
George W. Bush : And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry?
Bob Schieffer : Thirty seconds.
John Kerry : Once again, the president is misleading America.
John Kerry : I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills.
John Kerry : But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s.
John Kerry : And I'm very proud of that.
John Kerry : So the president's wrong.
Bob Schieffer : Let me direct the next question to you, Senator Kerry, and again, let's stay on health care.
Bob Schieffer : You have, as you have proposed and as the president has commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children.
Bob Schieffer : You're also talking about the government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital.
Bob Schieffer : And you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper 2 percent.
Bob Schieffer : You heard the president say earlier tonight that it's going to cost a whole lot more money than that.
Bob Schieffer : I'd just ask you, where are you going to get the money?
John Kerry : Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect.
John Kerry : One called it fiction.
John Kerry : The other called it untrue.
John Kerry : The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple.
John Kerry : It gives you the choice.
John Kerry : I don't force you to do anything.
John Kerry : It's not a government plan.
John Kerry : The government doesn't require you to do anything.
John Kerry : You choose your doctor.
John Kerry : You choose your plan.
John Kerry : If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.
John Kerry : You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits.
John Kerry : But I got a better plan.
John Kerry : And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today.
John Kerry : Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.
John Kerry : And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.
John Kerry : It's their choice.
John Kerry : I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.
John Kerry : We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.
John Kerry : If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American.
John Kerry : I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.
John Kerry : You want to buy into it, you can.
John Kerry : We give you broader competition.
John Kerry : That helps lower prices.
John Kerry : In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.
John Kerry : And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.
John Kerry : Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.
John Kerry : It works.
John Kerry : And I'm going to offer it to America.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.
George W. Bush : Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report.
George W. Bush : The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.
George W. Bush : They analyzed the senator's plan.
George W. Bush : It cost $1.2 trillion.
George W. Bush : The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.
George W. Bush : It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.
George W. Bush : If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees.
George W. Bush : Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them?
George W. Bush : It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.
George W. Bush : We have a fundamental difference of opinion.
George W. Bush : I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.
George W. Bush : Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls.
George W. Bush : And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care.
George W. Bush : They have poor-quality health care.
George W. Bush : Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.
Bob Schieffer : Senator?
John Kerry : The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality.
John Kerry : Now, maybe that explains why he hasn't fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining.
John Kerry : Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.
John Kerry : He doesn't adequately fund it.
John Kerry : But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.
John Kerry : That's not what I have.
John Kerry : I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield.
John Kerry : Senators and congressmen have a wide choice.
John Kerry : Americans ought to have it too.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : Talk about the VA: We've increased VA funding by $22 billion in the four years since I've been president.
George W. Bush : That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.
George W. Bush : Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.
George W. Bush : We're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country.
George W. Bush : We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.
George W. Bush : Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President, the next question is to you.
Bob Schieffer : We all know that Social Security is running out of money, and it has to be fixed.
Bob Schieffer : You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts.
Bob Schieffer : But the critics are saying that's going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up.
Bob Schieffer : So where do you get the money?
Bob Schieffer : Are you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years?
George W. Bush : First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.
George W. Bush : I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away.
George W. Bush : Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks.
George W. Bush : There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem.
George W. Bush : And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.
George W. Bush : And so I think we need to think differently.
George W. Bush : We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.
George W. Bush : But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.
George W. Bush : And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue.
George W. Bush : It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat.
George W. Bush : And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.
George W. Bush : I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust.
George W. Bush : And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.
George W. Bush : I will work with Republicans and Democrats.
George W. Bush : It'll be a vital issue in my second term.
George W. Bush : It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I'll bring Republicans and Democrats together.
George W. Bush : And we're of course going to have to consider the costs.
George W. Bush : But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry?
John Kerry : You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.
John Kerry : Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.
John Kerry : The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.
John Kerry : And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.
John Kerry : Now, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from?
John Kerry : He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for.
John Kerry : Not one of them are paid for.
John Kerry : The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history.
John Kerry : He's broken the pay-as-you-go rules.
John Kerry : I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility.
John Kerry : In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party.
John Kerry : We balanced the budget in the '90s.
John Kerry : We paid down the debt for two years.
John Kerry : And that's what we're going to do.
John Kerry : We're going to protect Social Security.
John Kerry : I will not privatize it.
John Kerry : I will not cut the benefits.
John Kerry : And we're going to be fiscally responsible.
John Kerry : And we will take care of Social Security.
Bob Schieffer : Let me just stay on Social Security with a new question for Senator Kerry, because, Senator Kerry, you have just said you will not cut benefits.
Bob Schieffer : Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, says there's no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate.
Bob Schieffer : What he's suggesting, we're going to cut benefits or we're going to have to raise the retirement age.
Bob Schieffer : We may have to take some other reform.
Bob Schieffer : But if you've just said, you've promised no changes, does that mean you're just going to leave this as a problem, another problem for our children to solve?
John Kerry : Not at all.
John Kerry : Absolutely not, Bob.
John Kerry : "This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on ""Meet the Press"" with Tim Russert in 1990-something."
John Kerry : We heard the same thing.
John Kerry : We fixed it.
John Kerry : In fact, we put together a $5.6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security.
John Kerry : If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.
John Kerry : The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.
John Kerry : Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut.
John Kerry : I don't.
John Kerry : I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.
John Kerry : And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.
John Kerry : Now, we can do that.
John Kerry : Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country.
John Kerry : We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.
John Kerry : And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.
John Kerry : But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America.
John Kerry : The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.
John Kerry : And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs.
John Kerry : Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.
John Kerry : I have a plan to put America back to work.
John Kerry : And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time.
George W. Bush : I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security.
George W. Bush : I heard more of the same.
George W. Bush : He talks about middle-class tax cuts.
George W. Bush : That's exactly where the tax cuts went.
George W. Bush : Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.
George W. Bush : And now the tax code is more fair.
George W. Bush : Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.
George W. Bush : People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed.
George W. Bush : If you have a child, you got tax relief.
George W. Bush : If you're married, you got tax relief.
George W. Bush : If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief.
George W. Bush : All of which was opposed by my opponent.
George W. Bush : And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession.
George W. Bush : People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.
George W. Bush : And it was one of the largest declines in our history.
George W. Bush : And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.
George W. Bush : But we acted.
George W. Bush : I led the Congress.
George W. Bush : We passed tax relief.
George W. Bush : And now this economy is growing.
George W. Bush : We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.
George W. Bush : Sure, there's more work to do.
George W. Bush : But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.
George W. Bush : It's not to increase the scope of the federal government.
George W. Bush : It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low.
Bob Schieffer : Let's go to a new question, Mr. President.
Bob Schieffer : I got more e-mail this week on this question than any other question.
Bob Schieffer : And it is about immigration.
Bob Schieffer : I'm told that at least 8,000 people cross our borders illegally every day.
Bob Schieffer : Some people believe this is a security issue, as you know.
Bob Schieffer : Some believe it's an economic issue.
Bob Schieffer : Some see it as a human-rights issue.
Bob Schieffer : How do you see it?
Bob Schieffer : And what do we need to do about it?
George W. Bush : I see it as a serious problem.
George W. Bush : I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue.
George W. Bush : We're increasing the border security of the United States.
George W. Bush : We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.
George W. Bush : We're using new equipment.
George W. Bush : We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.
George W. Bush : And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.
George W. Bush : It's a subject I'm very familiar with.
George W. Bush : After all, I was a border governor for a while.
George W. Bush : Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons.
George W. Bush : They're coming here to work.
George W. Bush : If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.
George W. Bush : And that's what's happening.
George W. Bush : And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.
George W. Bush : That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.
George W. Bush : It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families.
George W. Bush : See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.
George W. Bush : It also means it takes pressure off the border.
George W. Bush : If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border.
George W. Bush : It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.
George W. Bush : Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty.
George W. Bush : I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.
George W. Bush : There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.
George W. Bush : And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.
George W. Bush : If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.
George W. Bush : And here is where my opponent and I differ.
George W. Bush : In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.
Bob Schieffer : Time's up.
Bob Schieffer : Senator?
John Kerry : Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.
John Kerry : The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.
John Kerry : And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs.
John Kerry : The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929.
John Kerry : And the take-home pay of the richest .
John Kerry : 1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928.
John Kerry : Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.
John Kerry : Now that's wrong.
John Kerry : Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform.
John Kerry : He said he would reform it.
John Kerry : Four years later he is now promising another plan.
John Kerry : Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.
John Kerry : The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will.
John Kerry : Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem.
John Kerry : The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring.
John Kerry : It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.
John Kerry : And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American.
John Kerry : We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.
Bob Schieffer : Do you want to respond, Mr. President?
George W. Bush : Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.
George W. Bush : They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.
George W. Bush : We have much more manpower and much more equipment there.
George W. Bush : He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.
George W. Bush : That is an outrageous claim.
George W. Bush : And we'll continue to protect our borders.
George W. Bush : We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.
Bob Schieffer : Senator?
John Kerry : Four thousand people a day are coming across the border.
John Kerry : The fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border.
John Kerry : And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.
John Kerry : We have iris-identification technology.
John Kerry : We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today.
John Kerry : We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.
John Kerry : We could speed it up.
John Kerry : There are huge delays.
John Kerry : The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure.
Bob Schieffer : Next question to you, Senator Kerry.
Bob Schieffer : The gap between rich and poor is growing wider.
Bob Schieffer : More people are dropping into poverty.
Bob Schieffer : Yet the minimum wage has been stuck at, what, $5.15 an hour now for about seven years.
Bob Schieffer : Is it time to raise it?
John Kerry : Well, I'm glad you raised that question.
John Kerry : It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.
John Kerry : And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.
John Kerry : We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.
John Kerry : But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it.
John Kerry : We're not allowed to vote on it.
John Kerry : They don't want to raise the minimum wage.
John Kerry : The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years.
John Kerry : If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9.2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year.
John Kerry : The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.
John Kerry : One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families.
John Kerry : What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.
John Kerry : We also need to hold on to equal pay.
John Kerry : Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.
John Kerry : That's not right in America.
John Kerry : And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women's pay.
John Kerry : They've cut it off.
John Kerry : They've stopped it.
John Kerry : They don't enforce these kinds of things.
John Kerry : Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.
John Kerry : We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream.
John Kerry : And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.
John Kerry : I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.
George W. Bush : Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage.
George W. Bush : But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to.
George W. Bush : And that's to make sure the education system works.
George W. Bush : It's to make sure we raise standards.
George W. Bush : Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.
George W. Bush : "The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards."
George W. Bush : We'll increase federal spending.
George W. Bush : "But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. """
George W. Bush : You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem.
George W. Bush : And we weren't diagnosing problems.
George W. Bush : And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school.
George W. Bush : And guess who would get shuffled through?
George W. Bush : Children whose parents wouldn't speak English as a first language just move through.
George W. Bush : Many inner-city kids just move through.
George W. Bush : We've stopped that practice now by measuring early.
George W. Bush : And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it.
George W. Bush : "I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, ""Reading is the new civil right,"" and she's right."
George W. Bush : In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now.
George W. Bush : You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President, I want to go back to something Senator Kerry said earlier tonight and ask a follow-up of my own.
Bob Schieffer : He said -- and this will be a new question to you -- he said that you had never said whether you would like to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Bob Schieffer : So I'd ask you directly, would you like to?
George W. Bush : What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?
George W. Bush : And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test.
George W. Bush : I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry, you'd like to respond?
John Kerry : Is that a new question or a 30-second question?
Bob Schieffer : That's a new question for Senator -- for President Bush.
John Kerry : Which time limit.
John Kerry : 0
John Kerry : 0
Bob Schieffer : You have 90 seconds.
John Kerry : Thank you very much.
John Kerry : Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.
John Kerry : I'll answer it straight to America.
John Kerry : I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.
John Kerry : And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right.
John Kerry : So I don't intend to see it undone.
John Kerry : Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.
John Kerry : But let me go a step further.
John Kerry : We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.
John Kerry : I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.
John Kerry : And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.
John Kerry : Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens.
John Kerry : The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.
John Kerry : He'll tell you he's raised the money, and he has.
John Kerry : But he didn't put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children.
Bob Schieffer : Yes, sir?
George W. Bush : Two things.
George W. Bush : One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with.
George W. Bush : And secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough.
George W. Bush : We've increased funds.
George W. Bush : But more importantly, we've reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they're too late.
George W. Bush : He talked about the unemployed.
George W. Bush : Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.
George W. Bush : He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language?
George W. Bush : Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.
George W. Bush : And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does.
Bob Schieffer : Senator?
John Kerry : You don't measure it by a percentage increase.
John Kerry : Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done.
John Kerry : Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget.
John Kerry : Now, that's not in my gut.
John Kerry : That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut.
John Kerry : $89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.
John Kerry : You be the judge.
Bob Schieffer : All right, let's go to another question.
Bob Schieffer : And it is to Senator Kerry.
Bob Schieffer : You have two minutes, sir.
Bob Schieffer : Senator, the last debate, President Bush said he did not favor a draft.
Bob Schieffer : You agreed with him.
Bob Schieffer : But our National Guard and Reserve forces are being severely strained because many of them are being held beyond their enlistments.
Bob Schieffer : Some of them say that it's a back-door draft.
Bob Schieffer : Is there any relief that could be offered to these brave Americans and their families?
Bob Schieffer : If you became president, Senator Kerry, what would you do about this situation of holding National Guard and Reservists for these extended periods of time and these repeated call-ups that they're now facing?
John Kerry : Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces.
John Kerry : Our military is overextended.
John Kerry : Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.
John Kerry : One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.
John Kerry : Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.
John Kerry : In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve.
John Kerry : And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.
John Kerry : There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security.
John Kerry : We ought to be doing that.
John Kerry : And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.
John Kerry : But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.
John Kerry : I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war.
John Kerry : He said he would work through a real alliance.
John Kerry : He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.
John Kerry : Well, we didn't.
John Kerry : And the result is our forces today are overextended.
John Kerry : The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result.
John Kerry : And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably.
John Kerry : And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing.
George W. Bush : We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year.
George W. Bush : I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.
George W. Bush : Some of them had been there before.
George W. Bush : The people I talked to their spirits were high.
George W. Bush : They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.
George W. Bush : They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.
George W. Bush : My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.
George W. Bush : In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test.
George W. Bush : In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval.
George W. Bush : That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.
George W. Bush : I'll work with allies.
George W. Bush : I'll work with friends.
George W. Bush : We'll continue to build strong coalitions.
George W. Bush : But I will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries.
George W. Bush : We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.
Bob Schieffer : Senator?
John Kerry : I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation.
John Kerry : In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.
John Kerry : No nation will ever have a veto over us.
John Kerry : But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard.
John Kerry : That's how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that's how you gain legitimacy in the world.
John Kerry : But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America.
George W. Bush : In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.
George W. Bush : The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force.
George W. Bush : Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President, new question, two minutes.
Bob Schieffer : You said that if Congress would vote to extend the ban on assault weapons, that you'd sign the legislation, but you did nothing to encourage the Congress to extend it.
Bob Schieffer : Why not?
George W. Bush : Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.
George W. Bush : I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.
George W. Bush : I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun.
George W. Bush : I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.
George W. Bush : But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.
George W. Bush : And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.
George W. Bush : And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.
George W. Bush : Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.
George W. Bush : To me, that's the best way to secure America.
Bob Schieffer : Senator?
John Kerry : I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.
John Kerry : I am a hunter.
John Kerry : I'm a gun owner.
John Kerry : I've been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old.
John Kerry : And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment.
John Kerry : But I'll tell you this.
John Kerry : I'm also a former law enforcement officer.
John Kerry : I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.
John Kerry : I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.
John Kerry : I've broken up organized crime.
John Kerry : I know something about prosecuting.
John Kerry : And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban.
John Kerry : They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47.
John Kerry : "I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?"
John Kerry : "We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. """
John Kerry : Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous.
John Kerry : Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.
John Kerry : And that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan.
John Kerry : It encouraged them to do it.
John Kerry : So I believe America's less safe.
John Kerry : "If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, ""Sorry, we don't have the votes,"" I'd have said, ""Then we're going to have a fight. """
John Kerry : And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.
John Kerry : We'd have won what Bill Clinton won.
Bob Schieffer : Let's go to a new question.
Bob Schieffer : For you, Senator Kerry, two minutes.
Bob Schieffer : Affirmative action: Do you see a need for affirmative action programs, or have we moved far enough along that we no longer need to use race and gender as a factor in school admissions and federal and state contracts and so on?
John Kerry : No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along.
John Kerry : And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.
John Kerry : I'll give you an example.
John Kerry : I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time.
John Kerry : I was chairman of it once.
John Kerry : Now I'm the senior Democrat on it.
John Kerry : We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country.
John Kerry : They don't reach those goals.
John Kerry : They don't even fight to reach those goals.
John Kerry : They've tried to undo them.
John Kerry : The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination.
John Kerry : And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.
John Kerry : Some people have a mistaken view of it in America.
John Kerry : It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.
John Kerry : I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably.
John Kerry : If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.
John Kerry : During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.
John Kerry : And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching.
John Kerry : "So we had a policy called ""Mend it, don't end it."
John Kerry : """We fixed it."
John Kerry : And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel.
John Kerry : As president, I will make certain we travel it.
John Kerry : Now, let me just share something.
John Kerry : This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.
John Kerry : This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.
John Kerry : This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.
John Kerry : If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?
John Kerry : I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.
George W. Bush : I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.
George W. Bush : And secondly, like my opponent, I don't agree we ought to have quotas.
George W. Bush : I agree, we shouldn't have quotas.
George W. Bush : But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done.
George W. Bush : We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students.
George W. Bush : Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college?
George W. Bush : That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma.
George W. Bush : I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going.
George W. Bush : Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong.
George W. Bush : I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.
George W. Bush : Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before.
George W. Bush : And that's hopeful, and that's positive.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President, let's go to a new question.
Bob Schieffer : You were asked before the invasion, or after the invasion, of Iraq if you'd checked with your dad.
Bob Schieffer : And I believe, I don't remember the quote exactly, but I believe you said you had checked with a higher authority.
Bob Schieffer : I would like to ask you, what part does your faith play on your policy decisions?
Bob Schieffer : First, my faith plays a lot -- a big part in my life.
Bob Schieffer : And that's, when I was answering that question, what I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot.
Bob Schieffer : And I do.
Bob Schieffer : And my faith is a very -- it's very personal.
Bob Schieffer : I pray for strength.
Bob Schieffer : I pray for wisdom.
Bob Schieffer : I pray for our troops in harm's way.
Bob Schieffer : I pray for my family.
Bob Schieffer : I pray for my little girls.
Bob Schieffer : But I'm mindful in a free society that people can worship if they want to or not.
Bob Schieffer : You're equally an American if you choose to worship an almighty and if you choose not to.
Bob Schieffer : If you're a Christian, Jew or Muslim, you're equally an American.
Bob Schieffer : That's the great thing about America, is the right to worship the way you see fit.
Bob Schieffer : Prayer and religion sustain me.
Bob Schieffer : I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency.
Bob Schieffer : I love the fact that people pray for me and my family all around the country.
Bob Schieffer : "Somebody asked me one time, ""Well, how do you know?"
Bob Schieffer : """I said, ""I just feel it. """
Bob Schieffer : Religion is an important part.
Bob Schieffer : I never want to impose my religion on anybody else.
Bob Schieffer : But when I make decisions, I stand on principle, and the principles are derived from who I am.
Bob Schieffer : I believe we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself, as manifested in public policy through the faith-based initiative where we've unleashed the armies of compassion to help heal people who hurt.
Bob Schieffer : I believe that God wants everybody to be free.
Bob Schieffer : That's what I believe.
Bob Schieffer : And that's been part of my foreign policy.
Bob Schieffer : In Afghanistan, I believe that the freedom there is a gift from the Almighty.
Bob Schieffer : And I can't tell you how encouraged I am to see freedom on the march.
Bob Schieffer : And so my principles that I make decisions on are a part of me, and religion is a part of me.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry?
John Kerry : Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith.
John Kerry : I think it's important and I share it.
John Kerry : I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty.
John Kerry : Everything is a gift from the Almighty.
John Kerry : And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.
John Kerry : And people all find their ways to express it.
John Kerry : I was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.
John Kerry : And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet.
John Kerry : We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.
John Kerry : There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.
John Kerry : And we're struggling with that today.
John Kerry : And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith.
John Kerry : I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead.
John Kerry : I think we've got a lot more work to do.
John Kerry : And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America.
Bob Schieffer : Senator Kerry, after 9/11 -- and this is a new question for you -- it seemed to me that the country came together as I've never seen it come together since World War II.
Bob Schieffer : But some of that seems to have melted away.
Bob Schieffer : I think it's fair to say we've become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season.
Bob Schieffer : But if you were elected president, or whoever is elected president, will you set a priority in trying to bring the nation back together?
Bob Schieffer : Or what would be your attitude on that?
John Kerry : Very much so.
John Kerry : Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.
John Kerry : I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job.
John Kerry : And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress.
John Kerry : And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans.
John Kerry : That's where we were.
John Kerry : That's not where we are today.
John Kerry : I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country.
John Kerry : I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States.
John Kerry : I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.
John Kerry : We have to change that.
John Kerry : And as president, I am committed to changing that.
John Kerry : I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.
John Kerry : I think we have to come together and work to change it.
John Kerry : And I've done that.
John Kerry : Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues.
John Kerry : I've reached across the aisle.
John Kerry : I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.
John Kerry : And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.
John Kerry : And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.
Bob Schieffer : Mr. President?
George W. Bush : My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is.
George W. Bush : I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas, and I was hopeful I'd be able to do the same thing.
George W. Bush : And we made good progress early on.
George W. Bush : The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.
George W. Bush : And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow.
George W. Bush : But Washington is a tough town.
George W. Bush : And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.
George W. Bush : I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.
George W. Bush : My opponent said this is a bitterly divided time.
George W. Bush : Pretty divided in the 2000 election.
George W. Bush : So in other words, it's pretty divided during the 1990s as well.
George W. Bush : We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did.
George W. Bush : John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq.
George W. Bush : And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.
Bob Schieffer : We've come, gentlemen, to our last question.
Bob Schieffer : And it occurred to me as I came to this debate tonight that the three of us share something.
Bob Schieffer : All three of us are surrounded by very strong women.
Bob Schieffer : We're all married to strong women.
Bob Schieffer : Each of us have two daughters that make us very proud.
Bob Schieffer : I'd like to ask each of you, what is the most important thing you've learned from these strong women?
George W. Bush : To listen to them.
George W. Bush : (LAUGHTER)
George W. Bush : To stand up straight and not scowl.
George W. Bush : (LAUGHTER)
George W. Bush : I love the strong women around me.
George W. Bush : I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters.
George W. Bush : I am -- you know it's really interesting.
George W. Bush : "I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, ""Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech."
George W. Bush : """I said, ""OK, you've got a deal."
George W. Bush : """Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."
George W. Bush : And she's out campaigning along with our girls.
George W. Bush : And she speaks English a lot better than I do.
George W. Bush : I think people understand what she's saying.
George W. Bush : But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush.
George W. Bush : I can't tell you how lucky I am.
George W. Bush : When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue.
George W. Bush : "O'Neill said, ""Come on over."
George W. Bush : I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.
George W. Bush : """So I said all right."
George W. Bush : Bopped over there.
George W. Bush : There was only four of us there.

John Kerry : (LAUGHTER)
John Kerry : But I can take it.
John Kerry : (LAUGHTER)
John Kerry : Can I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didn't ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run.
John Kerry : And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing.
John Kerry : "And she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said, ""Remember: integrity, integrity, integrity."
John Kerry : """Those are the three words that she left me with."
John Kerry : And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong.
John Kerry : They also kick me around.
John Kerry : They keep me honest.
John Kerry : They don't let me get away with anything.
John Kerry : I can sometimes take myself too seriously.
John Kerry : They surely don't let me do that.
