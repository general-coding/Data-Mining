Information : This is a transcript of the third presidential debate.
Information : The event took place on October 19, in East Lansing, Michigan.
Information : The two-part format used a single moderator question period for the first half of the debate, and a panel of journalist asking questions in the second half of the debate.
Information : Jim Lehrer details the format in his opening remarks.
Information : The transcript is approximately 35 pages in length.
Jim Lehrer : Good evening.
Jim Lehrer : Welcome to this third and final debate among the three major candidates for president of the US.
Jim Lehrer : Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, President George Bush, the Republican nominee, --
Jim Lehrer : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : -- and independent candidate Ross Perot.
Jim Lehrer : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on PBS.
Jim Lehrer : I will be the moderator for this debate, which is being sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
Jim Lehrer : It will be 90 minutes long.
Jim Lehrer : It is happening before an audience on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing.
Jim Lehrer : The format was conceived by and agreed to by representatives of the Bush and Clinton campaigns, and it is somewhat different than those used in the earlier debates.
Jim Lehrer : I will ask questions for the first half under rules that permit follow-ups.
Jim Lehrer : A panel of 3 other journalists will ask questions in the 2nd half under rules that do not.
Jim Lehrer : As always, each candidate will have 2 minutes, up to 2 minutes, to make a closing statement.
Jim Lehrer : The order of those, as well as that for the formal questioning, were all determined by a drawing.
Jim Lehrer : Gentlemen, again welcome and again good evening.
Jim Lehrer : It seems, from what some of those voters said at your Richmond debate, and from polling and other data, that each of you, fairly or not, faces serious voter concerns about the underlying credibility and believability of what each of you says you would do as president in the next 4 years.
Jim Lehrer : Governor Clinton, in accordance with the draw, those concerns about you are first: you are promising to create jobs, reduce the deficit, reform the health care system, rebuild the infrastructure, guarantee college education for everyone who is qualified, among many other things, all with financial pain only for the very rich.
Jim Lehrer : Some people are having trouble apparently believing that is possible.
Jim Lehrer : Should they have that concern?
Bill Clinton : No.
Bill Clinton : There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.
Bill Clinton : The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.
Bill Clinton : Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.
Bill Clinton : But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.
Bill Clinton : It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.
Bill Clinton : I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.
Bill Clinton : I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.
Bill Clinton : Invest and grow.
Bill Clinton : Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems.
Bill Clinton : This will work.
Bill Clinton : On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.
Bill Clinton : I don't believe trickle down economics will work.
Bill Clinton : Unemployment is up.
Bill Clinton : Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.
Bill Clinton : I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, a response.
George Bush : Do I have 1 minute?
George Bush : Just the ground rules here.
Jim Lehrer : Roughly 1 minute.
Jim Lehrer : We can loosen that up a little bit but go ahead.
George Bush : Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs.
George Bush : The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.
George Bush : And what I don't like is trickle down government.
George Bush : And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and he's still talking about spending more and taxing more.
George Bush : Government -- he says invest government, grow government.
George Bush : Government doesn't create jobs.
George Bush : If they do, they're make-work jobs.
George Bush : It's the private sector that creates jobs.
George Bush : And yes, we've got too many taxes on the American people and we're spending too much.
George Bush : And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.
George Bush : It won't be painless.
George Bush : I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.
George Bush : It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.
George Bush : But not by raising taxes.
George Bush : Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures don't add up and he's going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes.
George Bush : So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.
George Bush : I do not want any more trickle down government.
George Bush : It's gotten too big.
George Bush : I want to do something about that.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, what do you think of the governor's approach, what he just laid out?
Ross Perot : The basic problem with it, it doesn't balance the budget.
Ross Perot : If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them.
Ross Perot : Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.
Ross Perot : If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding.
Ross Perot : And we are bleeding arterially.
Ross Perot : There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base -- see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact.
Ross Perot : We have spent their money.
Ross Perot : We've got to pay it back.
Ross Perot : This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice.
Ross Perot : My plan balances the budget within 6 years.
Ross Perot : We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.
Ross Perot : We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover.
Ross Perot : But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.
Ross Perot : The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.
Ross Perot : You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.
Ross Perot : I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into.
Jim Lehrer : "Governor, the word ""pain"" -- one of the other leadership things that's put on you is that you don't speak of pain, that you speak of all things -- nobody's going to really have to suffer under your plan."
Jim Lehrer : You've heard what Mr. Perot has said.
Jim Lehrer : He's said it's got -- to do the things that you want to do, you can't do it by just taking the money from the rich.
Jim Lehrer : That's what the president says as well.
Jim Lehrer : How do you respond to that?
Jim Lehrer : They said the numbers don't add up.
Bill Clinton : I disagree with both of them.
Bill Clinton : For one thing, let me just follow up here.
Bill Clinton : I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise -- put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy.
Bill Clinton : His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.
Bill Clinton : And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.
Bill Clinton : And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.
Bill Clinton : He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.
Bill Clinton : And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.
Bill Clinton : Now, it's hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years.
Bill Clinton : So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.
Bill Clinton : Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?
Bill Clinton : Yes.
Bill Clinton : Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they're upper income people?
Bill Clinton : Yes.
Bill Clinton : But look what's happened to the middle class.
Bill Clinton : Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.
Bill Clinton : The tax burden on them has not gone down.
Bill Clinton : It has gone up.
Bill Clinton : I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.
Bill Clinton : The answer is to invest and grow this economy.
Bill Clinton : That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.
Jim Lehrer : As a practical matter, Mr. President, do you agree with the governor when he says that the middle class, the taxes on the middle class -- do your numbers agree that the taxes on the middle class have gone up during the last --
George Bush : I think everybody's paying too much taxes.
George Bush : He refers to one tax increase.
George Bush : Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.
George Bush : And I said I make a mistake.
George Bush : If I make a mistake, I admit it.
George Bush : That's quite different than some.
George Bush : But I think that's the American way.
George Bush : I think everyone's paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and -- then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill.
George Bush : Yes, I did.
George Bush : And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress.
George Bush : We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates -- who remembers that?
George Bush : They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15.
George Bush : We don't want to go back to that.
George Bush : And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill that's gonna raise taxes on people.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, when you said just then that you admit your mistakes and you looked at Governor Clinton and said -- what mistake is it that you want him to admit to?
George Bush : Well, the record in Arkansas.
George Bush : I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have?
George Bush : Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.
George Bush : They are.
George Bush : But in almost every category they're lagging.
George Bush : I'll give you an example.
George Bush : He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or 2 years.
George Bush : Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average.
George Bush : On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom.
George Bush : You haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective.
George Bush : And I'm going to do that.
George Bush : It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.
George Bush : So we've got to do that.
George Bush : I gotta get it in perspective.
George Bush : What's his mistake?
George Bush : Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, is that true?
Bill Clinton : Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first.
George Bush : This year.
Bill Clinton : 4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.
Bill Clinton : Over the last 10 years we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average.
Bill Clinton : Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.
Bill Clinton : We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.
Bill Clinton : We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.
Bill Clinton : We're low spending, low tax burden.
Bill Clinton : We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.
Bill Clinton : I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, if you were sitting at home now and just heard this exchange about Arkansas, who would you believe?
Ross Perot : I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.
Ross Perot : Let's put it in perspective.
Ross Perot : It's a beautiful state.
Ross Perot : It's a fairly rural state.
Ross Perot : It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.
Ross Perot : So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.
Jim Lehrer : Why is that a mistake?
Ross Perot : It's irrelevant.
Ross Perot : (Laughter)
Jim Lehrer : What he did as governor of Arkansas is irrelevant?
Ross Perot : No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.
Ross Perot : That's not true.
Ross Perot : (Laughter)
Ross Perot : I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.
Jim Lehrer : Governor?
Bill Clinton : Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.
Bill Clinton : And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant.
Bill Clinton : I think it's been pretty impressive.
Ross Perot : It's not --
Bill Clinton : And the people who have jobs --
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Bill Clinton : The people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all; they think it's highly relevant and they wish the rest of the country had them.
George Bush : I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.
Bill Clinton : Well, you think it's relevant.
Bill Clinton : (Laughter)
George Bush : Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment -- he has to do it, that is the law.
George Bush : I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that's been in control of one party, his party, for 38 years.
George Bush : And we almost had it done.
George Bush : "And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling ""Clean House!"""
George Bush : One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker -- a very, able, decent fellow, I might add -- but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote.
George Bush : What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people.
George Bush : I want the line-item veto.
George Bush : I want a check-off, so if the Congress can't do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending.
George Bush : And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.
George Bush : That's what we call a sequester.
George Bush : That's the discipline we need, and I'm working for that -- to protect the American taxpayer against the big spenders.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, let's move to some of the leadership concerns that have been voiced about you.
Jim Lehrer : And they relate to something you said in your closing statement in Richmond the other night about the president being the manager of crises.
Jim Lehrer : And that relates to an earlier criticism, that you began to focus on the economy, on health care, on racial divisions in this country, only after they became crises.
Jim Lehrer : Is that a fair criticism?
George Bush : Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.
George Bush : I hear it -- I hear it echoed by political opponents.
George Bush : But I don't think it's fair.
George Bush : I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.
George Bush : I'm for enterprise zones.
George Bush : I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.
George Bush : And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.
George Bush : I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.
George Bush : I've been speaking out since day 1.
George Bush : We've gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation.
George Bush : And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.
George Bush : And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.
George Bush : And that is good.
George Bush : I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.
George Bush : What was the other part of it?
Jim Lehrer : Well, it's just that -- you've spoken to it.
Jim Lehrer : I mean, but the idea, not so much in specifics, but that it has to be a crisis before it gets your attention.
George Bush : I don't think that's true at all.
George Bush : I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.
Jim Lehrer : Do you think that's true, Mr. Perot?
Ross Perot : I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --
Jim Lehrer : You don't think this is an issue?
Ross Perot : Well, no, but the point is that's a subjective thing.
Ross Perot : See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?
Ross Perot : And it would be very difficult for me to answer that in any short period of time.
Jim Lehrer : Well, then, let's phrase -- I'll phrase it differently, then.
Jim Lehrer : He said the other night in his closing words in Richmond that one of the key things that he believes the American people should decide between -- among the 3 of you is who they want in charge if this country gets to a crisis.
Jim Lehrer : Now, that's what he said, and the rap on the president is that it's only crisis time that he focuses on some of these things.
Jim Lehrer : So my question to you -- we're going to talk about you in a minute --
Jim Lehrer : (Laughter)
Jim Lehrer : -- my question to you --
Ross Perot : I thought you'd forgotten I was here.
Jim Lehrer : No, no, no, no, no.
Jim Lehrer : (Laughter)
Jim Lehrer : But my question to you is, so -- if you have nothing to say about it, fine, I'll go to Governor Clinton, but --
Ross Perot : I will let the American people decide that.
Ross Perot : I would rather not critique the 2 candidates.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, what do you think?
Bill Clinton : The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.
Bill Clinton : He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.
Bill Clinton : I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.
Bill Clinton : Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one.
Bill Clinton : I will deal with them from day 1.
Bill Clinton : They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President?
George Bush : Well, I think you're overlooking that we have had major accomplishments in the first term.
George Bush : But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.
George Bush : You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.
George Bush : Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%.
George Bush : The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.
George Bush : We've cut it in half.
George Bush : And all you hear about is how bad things are.
George Bush : You know, remember the question, are you better off?
George Bush : Well, is a homebuyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down?
George Bush : Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?
George Bush : I think they are.
George Bush : Is the guy out of work better off?
George Bush : Of course he's not, but he's not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government.
George Bush : You've got to free up the private sector.
George Bush : You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.
George Bush : For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.
George Bush : Capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first- time homebuyers.
George Bush : And it's blocked by the Congress.
George Bush : And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.
Jim Lehrer : I have to -- we have to talk about Ross Perot now or he'll get me, I'm sure.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, on this issue that I have raised at the very beginning and we've been talking about, which is leadership, as president of the US, it concerns -- my reading of it, at least, my concerns about you, as expressed by folks in the polls and other places, it goes like this.
Jim Lehrer : You had a problem with General Motors.
Jim Lehrer : You took your $750 million and you left.
Jim Lehrer : You had a problem in the spring and summer about some personal hits that you took as a potential candidate for president of the US and you walked out.
Jim Lehrer : Does that say anything relevant to how you would function as president of the US?
Ross Perot : I think the General Motors thing is very relevant.
Ross Perot : I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.
Ross Perot : They just wouldn't do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they're paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems.
Ross Perot : Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way.
Ross Perot : Our government is that point now.
Ross Perot : The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.
Ross Perot : If you have a heart problem, you don't wait till a heart attack to address it.
Ross Perot : So the General Motors experience is relevant.
Ross Perot : At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.
Ross Perot : I sold them my remaining shares.
Ross Perot : They went their way.
Ross Perot : I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.
Ross Perot : But let's take my life in perspective.
Ross Perot : Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course.
Ross Perot : When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.
Ross Perot : And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years.
Ross Perot : Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset.
Ross Perot : Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there.
Ross Perot : I could have rationalized it.
Ross Perot : We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.
Ross Perot : And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.
Ross Perot : Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.
Ross Perot : And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.
Ross Perot : Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again.
Ross Perot : But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.
Ross Perot : And talk about not quitting, I'm spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money.
Ross Perot : I put my wallet on the table for you and your children.
Ross Perot : Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.
Ross Perot : I've lived the American dream; I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too.
Ross Perot : (Laughter)
Jim Lehrer : Governor, do you have a response to the staying- the-course question about Mr. Perot?
Bill Clinton : I don't have any criticism of Mr. Perot.
Bill Clinton : I think what I'd like to talk about a minute, since you're asking the question, is the General Motors issue.
Bill Clinton : I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done.
Bill Clinton : And we're still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don't have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country.
Bill Clinton : Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.
Bill Clinton : They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.
Bill Clinton : We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.
Bill Clinton : We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.
Bill Clinton : So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.
Bill Clinton : But they didn't have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better.
Bill Clinton : That's one of the things I want to change.
Bill Clinton : I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.
Bill Clinton : We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, do you have a response?
George Bush : To this?
Jim Lehrer : Yes.
George Bush : Well, I wondered, when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers, whether he talked about his and Senator Gore's favoring CAFE standards, fuel efficiency standards, of 40 miles per gallon.
George Bush : That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.
George Bush : As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.
George Bush : I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.
George Bush : And I take it back, because I think -- he said he made a mistake.
George Bush : And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it.
George Bush : I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.
George Bush : But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.
George Bush : There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement.
George Bush : You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.
George Bush : So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, what about that charge?
Jim Lehrer : Do you want it both ways on this issue?
Bill Clinton : Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.
Bill Clinton : They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet.
Bill Clinton : I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.
Bill Clinton : I think that should be a goal.
Bill Clinton : I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.
Bill Clinton : The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000.
Bill Clinton : I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.
Bill Clinton : And let me say this.
Bill Clinton : I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.
Bill Clinton : That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.
Bill Clinton : Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer.
Bill Clinton : It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years.
Bill Clinton : In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.
Bill Clinton : But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.
Bill Clinton : We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas.
Bill Clinton : That's another way to improve the environment.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, based on your experience at General Motors, where do you come down on this?
Jim Lehrer : This has been thrown about, back and forth, during this campaign from the very beginning about jobs and CAFE standards.
Ross Perot : Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.
Ross Perot : Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.
Ross Perot : And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it.
Ross Perot : You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you're going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order.
Ross Perot : We've got to proceed very carefully on that.
Ross Perot : See, there's a lot I don't understand.
Ross Perot : I do understand business.
Ross Perot : I do understand creating jobs.
Ross Perot : I do understand how to make things work.
Ross Perot : And I got a long history of doing that.
Ross Perot : Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice.
Ross Perot : It's very simple.
Ross Perot : Everybody says it'll create jobs.
Ross Perot : Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.
Ross Perot : Now, you know, watch this -- listen very carefully to this.
Ross Perot : One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there.
Ross Perot : Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs.
Ross Perot : And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.
Ross Perot : We haven't got 12 days, folks.
Ross Perot : We cannot lose those jobs.
Ross Perot : They were eventually saying, Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour.
Ross Perot : Makes you feel real good to hear that, right?
Ross Perot : Let's think it through here.
Ross Perot : Let's be careful.
Ross Perot : I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.
Ross Perot : I hope we'll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull's-eye and tell you why we're losing whole industries in this country.
Jim Lehrer : Just for the record, though, Mr. Perot, I take it, then, from your answer, you do not have a position on whether or not enforcing the CAFE standards will cost jobs in the auto industry?
Ross Perot : Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.
Ross Perot : I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --
Jim Lehrer : Okay.
Ross Perot : I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?
Jim Lehrer : So that means -- in other words, you agree with President Bush; is that right?
Ross Perot : No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.
Ross Perot : Now please, folks, if you don't hear anything else I say, remember where the -- millions of people at work are our tax base.
Ross Perot : Jim, one quick point.
Ross Perot : If you confiscate the Forbes 400 wealth, take it all, you cannot balance the budget this year.
Ross Perot : Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.
Ross Perot : Millions and millions of people at work.
Jim Lehrer : Yes, sir.
George Bush : I'm caught in the middle on NAFTA.
George Bush : Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement.
George Bush : I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
George Bush : My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.
George Bush : Then the other day he says he's for it, however then we've got to pass other legislation.
George Bush : When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.
George Bush : And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.
George Bush : Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now?
George Bush : You have a differential in wages right now.
George Bush : I just have an honest philosophical difference.
George Bush : I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.
George Bush : I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.
George Bush : And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, quick answer on trade and I want to go on to something else.
Jim Lehrer : (APPLAUSE)
Bill Clinton : I'd like to respond to that.
Bill Clinton : You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.
Bill Clinton : Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country.
Bill Clinton : I am the one who's in the middle on this.
Bill Clinton : Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.
Bill Clinton : Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.
Bill Clinton : I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.
Bill Clinton : I have a realistic approach to trade.
Bill Clinton : I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement.
Bill Clinton : But it can sure be made better.
Bill Clinton : Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.
Bill Clinton : If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?
Bill Clinton : Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.
Bill Clinton : I want to change it.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : We've got about 4 --
George Bush : I think he made my case.
George Bush : On the one hand, it's a good deal but on the other hand I'd make it better.
George Bush : You can't do that as president.
George Bush : You can't do it on the war, where he says well, I was with the minority but I guess I would have voted with the majority.
George Bush : This is my point tonight.
George Bush : We're talking about 2 weeks from now you've gotta decide who's gonna be president.
George Bush : And there is this pattern that has plagued him in the primaries and now about trying to have it both ways on all these issues.
George Bush : You can't do that.
George Bush : And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.
George Bush : Right now we heard it.
George Bush : Ross is against it.
George Bush : I am for it.
George Bush : He says on the one hand I am for it and on the other hand I may be against it.
Jim Lehrer : The governor --
Jim Lehrer : (APPLAUSE)
Bill Clinton : That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.
Bill Clinton : His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better.
Bill Clinton : I believe we can be better.
Bill Clinton : I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes.
Bill Clinton : I want think they want somebody with common sense who can do what's best for the American people.
Bill Clinton : And I'd be happy to discuss these other issues, but I can't believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides.
Bill Clinton : He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.
Bill Clinton : (Laughter and applause)
Bill Clinton : He promised -- he -- you know -- let me just say --
George Bush : But I've always said trickle-down government is bad.
Bill Clinton : I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim.
Bill Clinton : Those 209 Americans last Thursday night in Richmond told us they wanted us to stop talking about each other and start talking about Americans and their problems and their promise, and I think we ought to get back to that.
Bill Clinton : I'll be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot.
Ross Perot : Is there an equal time rule tonight?
George Bush : Yes.
Ross Perot : Or do you just keep lunging in at will?
Ross Perot : I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2.
Ross Perot : Is that the way it works?
Jim Lehrer : No, it's -- Mr. Perot, you're doing fine.
Jim Lehrer : Go ahead.
Jim Lehrer : Whatever you want to say, say it.
Ross Perot : Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.
Jim Lehrer : Wait a minute.
Jim Lehrer : I was going to ask -- I thought you wanted to respond to what we're talking about.
Ross Perot : I do, I do.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Ross Perot : I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.
Ross Perot : Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.
Ross Perot : We don't have free trade.
Ross Perot : Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns.
Ross Perot : And if there's anything more unwise than that, I don't know what it is.
Ross Perot : Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it.
Ross Perot : I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.
Ross Perot : And you know, you've seen the list, I've seen the list, we won't go into the names, but no wonder they -- if I had those people around me all day every day, telling me it was fair and free, I might believe it.
Ross Perot : But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.
Ross Perot : Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and on and on.
Ross Perot : I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.
Ross Perot : And it goes on and on.
Ross Perot : And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.
Ross Perot : They're foreign lobbyists taking leaves.
Ross Perot : What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over?
Ross Perot : Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country.
Ross Perot : I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.
Ross Perot : I don't have a one of them, and I haven't taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will.
Ross Perot : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, how do you respond to that?
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot's made that charge several times.
Jim Lehrer : The fact that you have people working in your campaign who are paid foreign lobbyists.
George Bush : Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.
George Bush : And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.
George Bush : That's the American way.
George Bush : And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.
George Bush : I don't agree with that.
George Bush : But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this.
George Bush : I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts.
George Bush : Could be wrong, but I think so.
Ross Perot : And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.
Ross Perot : (Laughter)
George Bush : Well --
George Bush : (APPLAUSE)
George Bush : But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.
George Bush : The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.
George Bush : If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.
Ross Perot : One quick relevant specific.
Ross Perot : We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it.
Ross Perot : And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.
Ross Perot : But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.
Ross Perot : This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.
Ross Perot : One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.
Ross Perot : We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.
Ross Perot : If the president has any interest tonight, I'll detail it to you; I won't take 10 minutes tonight.
Ross Perot : All these things take a few minutes.
Ross Perot : But that's happening as we sit here today.
Ross Perot : We hammerlock the American companies -- American Airlines, Delta -- the last few great we have, because we're trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies.
Ross Perot : And never forget, they've got Airbus over there, and it's a government-owned, privately owned, consortium across Europe.
Ross Perot : They're dying to get the commercial airline business.
Ross Perot : Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business.
Ross Perot : I don't think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business.
Ross Perot : And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.
Ross Perot : (APPLAUSE)
Bill Clinton : Jim.
Jim Lehrer : Governor, I'm sorry, but that concludes my time with -- well, you...
Bill Clinton : Why, I had a great response to that.
Jim Lehrer : All right, go ahead, quick, quickly.
Bill Clinton : Just very briefly.
Bill Clinton : I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.
Bill Clinton : We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers' loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying.
Bill Clinton : And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.
Bill Clinton : I agree with that.
Bill Clinton : We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.
Bill Clinton : We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.
Bill Clinton : But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.
Bill Clinton : Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.
Bill Clinton : What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.
Bill Clinton : And we're in real trouble on that.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : I'm going to be in real trouble if I don't bring out -- it's now time...
George Bush : I promise it's less than 10 seconds.
Jim Lehrer : OK.
George Bush : I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.
George Bush : Productivity in this country is up, it is way up -- productivity is up.
George Bush : And that's a good thing.
George Bush : There are many good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that.
George Bush : Thank you.
Jim Lehrer : Now we're going to move to the 2nd half...
Ross Perot : Now give me 1 second...
Jim Lehrer : We're going to move to the...
Ross Perot : I've volunteered.
Ross Perot : Now, look, I'm just kind of a, you know, cur dog here; I was put on the ballot by the people, not special interests.
Ross Perot : So I have to stand up for myself.
Ross Perot : Now, Jim, let me get it out.
Ross Perot : On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done.
Ross Perot : I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country.
Ross Perot : That's kind of pathetic I have to do it -- and nobody's called me yet to come up, I might mention.
Ross Perot : (Laughter)
Jim Lehrer : All right, I want to bring in...
Ross Perot : But if they do -- if they do, it's easy to fix.
Ross Perot : If you all want the enterprise zones, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : Now we're going to bring in 3 other journalists to ask questions.
Jim Lehrer : They are Susan Rook of CNN, Gene Gibbons of Reuters and Helen Thomas of United Press Intl.
Jim Lehrer : You thought you'd never get in here, did you?
George Bush : Uh-uh.
George Bush : Uh-uh.
George Bush : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : OK we're going to continue on the subject of leadership and the first question goes to Gov Clinton for a 2-minute answer.
Jim Lehrer : It will be asked by Helen Thomas.
Jim Lehrer : Helen?
Helen Thomas : Governor Clinton, your credibility has come into question because of your different responses on the Vietnam draft.
Helen Thomas : If you had it to do over again, would you put on the nation's uniform, and if elected, could you in good conscience send someone to war?
Bill Clinton : If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better.
Bill Clinton : You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.
Bill Clinton : Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.
Bill Clinton : I was opposed to the war.
Bill Clinton : I couldn't help that.
Bill Clinton : I felt very strongly about it, and I didn't want to go at the time.
Bill Clinton : It's easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently.
Bill Clinton : President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldn't be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime.
Bill Clinton : We've had a lot of other presidents who didn't wear their country's uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt.
Bill Clinton : So the answer is I could do that.
Bill Clinton : I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.
Bill Clinton : I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president.
Bill Clinton : Could I do it?
Bill Clinton : Yes, I could.
Jim Lehrer : A reminder now.
Jim Lehrer : We're back on the St. Louis rules, which means that the governor had his answer and then each of you will have 1 minute to respond.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President.
George Bush : Well, I've expressed my heartfelt difference with Governor Clinton on organizing demonstrations while in a foreign land against your country, when young ghetto kids have been drafted and are dying.
George Bush : My argument with him on -- the question was about the draft -- is that there's this same pattern.
George Bush : In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.
George Bush : On April 17 he said he'd bring out all the records on the draft.
George Bush : They have not been forthcoming.
George Bush : He got a deferment or he didn't.
George Bush : He got a notice or he didn't.
George Bush : And I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft.
George Bush : A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft.
George Bush : But it's this pattern.
George Bush : And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you've got to, as president, you can't be on all these different sides, and you can't have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn't, then the facts come out and you change it.
George Bush : That's my big difference with him on the draft.
George Bush : It wasn't failing to serve.
Jim Lehrer : Your minute is up, sir.
George Bush : Yes, sir.
George Bush : Helen?
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, 1 minute.
Ross Perot : I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military.
Ross Perot : I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.
Ross Perot : I appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices.
Ross Perot : Appreciate the sacrifices their families make.
Ross Perot : That's been displayed again and again in a very tangible way.
Ross Perot : I look on this as history.
Ross Perot : I don't look on it personally as relevant, and I consider it really a waste of time tonight, when you consider the issues that face our country right now.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : The next question goes to President Bush and Gene Gibbons will ask it.
Jim Lehrer : Gene.
Jim Lehrer : (APPLAUSE)
Gene Gibbons : Mr. President, you keep saying that you made a mistake in agreeing to a tax increase to get the 1990 budget deal with Congress.
Gene Gibbons : But if you hadn't gotten that deal, you would have either had to get repeal of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Control Act or cut defense spending drastically at a time when the country was building up for the gulf war, and decimate domestic discretionary spending, including such things as air traffic control.
Gene Gibbons : If you had it to do all over again, sir, which of those alternatives would you choose?
George Bush : I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.
George Bush : I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.
George Bush : I did it for the very reasons you say.
George Bush : There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.
George Bush : One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.
George Bush : We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.
George Bush : But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy.
George Bush : I see no evidence that it has done it.
George Bush : So what would I have done?
George Bush : What should I have done?
George Bush : I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.
George Bush : So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.
George Bush : "I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling ""read my lips"", and I did it because I thought it was right."
George Bush : And I made a mistake.
George Bush : That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.
George Bush : That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.
George Bush : I thought it would be better for the country than it was.
George Bush : So there we are.
George Bush : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, 1 minute.
Ross Perot : 101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.
Ross Perot : Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.
Ross Perot : Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised.
Ross Perot : That's absolutely unconscionable.
Ross Perot : Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.
Ross Perot : This was not a way to pay down the deficit.
Ross Perot : This was a trick on the American people.
Ross Perot : That's not leadership.
Ross Perot : Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.
Ross Perot : If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.
Ross Perot : If you create Noriega, using taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.
Ross Perot : If you can't get your act together to pick him up one day when a Panamanian major has kidnapped him and a special forces team is 400 yards away and it's a stroll across the park to get him, and if you can't get your act together, at least pick up the Panamanian major, who they then killed, step up to the plate and admit it was a mistake.
Ross Perot : That's leadership, folks.
Ross Perot : Now, leaders will always make mistakes.
Ross Perot : We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.
Ross Perot : We've gotta change that.
Jim Lehrer : I'm taking responsibility for saying your time's up.
Ross Perot : I'm watching the lights.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : Governor Clinton, 1 minute, sir.
Bill Clinton : "The mistake that was made was making the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was."
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Bill Clinton : Knowing what the size of the deficit was, knowing there was no plan to control health care costs and knowing that we did not have a strategy to get real economic growth back into this economy.
Bill Clinton : The choices were not good then.
Bill Clinton : I think at the time, the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night in the middle of the night.
Bill Clinton : That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.
Bill Clinton : I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong.
Bill Clinton : I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.
Bill Clinton : He said it was in the public interest at the time and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was.
Bill Clinton : "The real mistake was the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place."
Bill Clinton : You just can't promise something like that just to get elected if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you.
Jim Lehrer : All right, Mr. Perot, the question is for you.
Jim Lehrer : You have a 2-minute answer, and it will be asked by Susan Rook.
Susan Rook : Mr. Perot, you've talked about going to Washington to do what the people who run this country want you to do.
Susan Rook : But it is the president's duty to lead, and often lead alone.
Susan Rook : How can you lead if you are forever seeking consensus before you act?
Ross Perot : You're talking about 2 different subjects.
Ross Perot : In order to lead, you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit and lead; then you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done, and that's where we are now.
Ross Perot : We can't get anything done.
Ross Perot : How do you get anything done when you've got all of these political action committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups -- and the list goes on and on and on.
Ross Perot : And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.
Ross Perot : You've got to go to the people.
Ross Perot : I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.
Ross Perot : I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.
Ross Perot : The point is, they'll get to decide what to think.
Ross Perot : (Laughter and applause)
Ross Perot : I love the fact that people will listen to a guy with a bad accent and a poor presentation manner talking about flip charts for 30 minutes, because they want the details.
Ross Perot : See, all the folks up there at the top said the attention span of the American people is no more than 5 minutes, they won't watch it.
Ross Perot : They're thirsty for it.
Ross Perot : You want to have a new program in this country.
Ross Perot : If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it'll happen.
Ross Perot : And that's a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it.
Ross Perot : Now, I think that's going back to where we started.
Ross Perot : That's having a government from the people.
Ross Perot : I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.
Ross Perot : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Governor Clinton, 1 minute.
Bill Clinton : Well, I believe in the town hall meetings; they started with my campaign in New Hampshire.
Bill Clinton : And I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them.
Bill Clinton : And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.
Bill Clinton : I've done a lot of them, and I'll continue to do them as president.
Bill Clinton : But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight.
Bill Clinton : Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.
Bill Clinton : And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.
Bill Clinton : It can be done.
Bill Clinton : That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : President Bush, 1 minute.
George Bush : I would like the record to show the panelists that Ross Perot took the first shot at the press.
George Bush : My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media.
George Bush : Re-elect President Bush.
George Bush : And I just had to work that in.
George Bush : Sorry, Helen.
George Bush : (Laughter and applause)
George Bush : I'm going to pay for this later on.
George Bush : Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein.
George Bush : Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army.
George Bush : But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand.
George Bush : And it's hard to build a consensus.
George Bush : We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.
George Bush : Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority.
George Bush : A president can't do that.
George Bush : Sometimes he has to act.
George Bush : And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.
George Bush : We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.
Jim Lehrer : All right, we're going to go on to another subject now, and the subject is priorities.
Jim Lehrer : The first question goes to you, President Bush, and Susan will ask it.
Susan Rook : President Bush, gentlemen, I acknowledge that all of you have women and ethnic minorities working for you and working with you.
Susan Rook : But when we look at the circle of the key people closest to you, your inner circle of advisers, we see white men only.
Susan Rook : Why?
Susan Rook : And when will that change?
George Bush : You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today.
Susan Rook : The key people, President Bush.
George Bush : Huh?
Susan Rook : The key people, the people beyond the glass ceiling.
Susan Rook : (APPLAUSE)
George Bush : I happen to think she's a key person.
George Bush : I think our Cabinet members are key people.
George Bush : I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer.
George Bush : Look at our Cabinet.
George Bush : You talk about somebody strong.
George Bush : Look at Carla Hills.
George Bush : Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.
George Bush : Look at our surgeon general, Dr. Novello.
George Bush : You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.
George Bush : Jim Baker's a man.
George Bush : Yeah, I plead guilty to that.
George Bush : (Laughter)
George Bush : But look who's around with him there.
George Bush : I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you.
George Bush : We've got a very good record appointing women to high positions and positions of trust, and I'm not defensive at all about it.
George Bush : What we got to do is keep working, as the Labor Dept is doing a first-class job on, to break down discrimination, to break down the glass ceiling.
George Bush : And I am not apologetic at all about our record with women.
George Bush : We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.
George Bush : Why not try to help them with my small business program to build some incentives into the system?
George Bush : I think we're making progress here.
George Bush : You got a lot of women running for office.
George Bush : As I said the other night, I hope a lot of them lose because they're liberal Democrats --
George Bush : (Laughter)
George Bush : -- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.
George Bush : But nevertheless, they're out there.
George Bush : And we got some very good Republican women running.
George Bush : So we're making dramatic progress.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, 1 minute.
Ross Perot : Well, I come from the computer business, and everybody knows the women are more talented than the men.
Ross Perot : So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.
Ross Perot : One of our first officers was a woman, the chief financial officer.
Ross Perot : She was a director.
Ross Perot : And it was so far back, it was considered so odd, and even though we were a tiny, little company at the time, it made all the national magazines.
Ross Perot : But in terms of being influenced by women and being a minority, there they are right out there, my wife and my 4 beautiful daughters, and I just have 1 son, so he and I are surrounded by women, giving -- telling us what to do all the time.
Ross Perot : (Laughter)
Ross Perot : And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein.
Ross Perot : We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.
Ross Perot : I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table.
Ross Perot : They're not the secrets to the nuclear bomb.
Ross Perot : Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.
Ross Perot : We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts.
Ross Perot : And if we didn't tell him that, why won't we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?
George Bush : I've got reply on that.
George Bush : That gets to the national honor.
George Bush : We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.
Ross Perot : Well, where are the papers?
George Bush : That is absolutely absurd.
Ross Perot : Where are the papers?
George Bush : Glaspie has testified --
George Bush : (APPLAUSE)
George Bush : -- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.
George Bush : Please, let's be factual.
Ross Perot : If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.
Ross Perot : And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.
Ross Perot : They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie.
Ross Perot : And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.
Ross Perot : We got Kuwait back to the emir but he's still not his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological and he's still over there, right?
Ross Perot : I'd like to see those written instructions.
Ross Perot : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, just to make sure that everybody knows what's going on here, when you responded directly to Mr. Perot, you violated the rule, your rules.
Jim Lehrer : Now --
George Bush : For which I apologize.
George Bush : When I make a mistake I say I'm sorry.
George Bush : (Laughter.)
Jim Lehrer : I just want to make sure everybody understands.
Jim Lehrer : If you all want to change the rules, we can do it.
George Bush : No, I don't.
George Bush : I apologize for it but that one got right to the national honor and I'm sorry.
George Bush : I just couldn't let it stand.
Jim Lehrer : Governor Clinton, you have a minute.
Bill Clinton : Susan, I don't agree that there are no women and minorities in important positions in my campaign.
Bill Clinton : There are many.
Bill Clinton : But I think even more relevant is my record at home.
Bill Clinton : For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.
Bill Clinton : An African American was my chief cabinet officer.
Bill Clinton : An African American was my chief economic development officer.
Bill Clinton : It was interesting today.
Bill Clinton : There was a story today or yesterday in the Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African Americans, even though the Post didn't mention that, which I think is a sign of progress.
Bill Clinton : The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.
Bill Clinton : So that's what I'll do as president.
Bill Clinton : I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : Next question goes to you, Mr. Perot.
Jim Lehrer : It's a 2-minute question and Helen will ask it.
Jim Lehrer : Helen?
Helen Thomas : Mr. Perot, what proof do you have that Saddam Hussein was told that he could have the -- do you have any actual proof or are you asking for the papers?
Helen Thomas : And also, I really came in with another question.
Helen Thomas : What is this penchant you have to investigate everyone?
Helen Thomas : Are those accusations correct -- investigating your staff, investigating the leaders of the grassroots movement, investigating associates of your family?
Ross Perot : No.
Ross Perot : They're not correct and if you look at my life, until I got involved in this effort, I was one person.
Ross Perot : And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.
Ross Perot : And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about.
Ross Perot : They investigated every single one of my children.
Ross Perot : They investigated my wife.
Ross Perot : They interviewed all of my children's friends from childhood on.
Ross Perot : They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator -- the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common.
Ross Perot : And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.
Ross Perot : So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.
Ross Perot : This goes on night and day.
Ross Perot : I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.
Ross Perot : One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form.
Ross Perot : It's a sick art form.
Ross Perot : Now, let's go back to Saddam Hussein.
Ross Perot : We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.
Ross Perot : That's a fact.
Ross Perot : We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.
Ross Perot : That's a fact.
Ross Perot : Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.
Ross Perot : And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and it's pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing.
Ross Perot : Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.
Ross Perot : So I say this is very simple.
Ross Perot : Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country.
Ross Perot : We later said no, that's not true.
Ross Perot : I said well, this is simple.
Ross Perot : What were her written instructions?
Ross Perot : We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally.
Ross Perot : Now, I say whose country is this?
Ross Perot : This is ours.
Ross Perot : Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?
Ross Perot : The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake.
Ross Perot : Nobody did any of this with evil intent.
Ross Perot : I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things.
Ross Perot : Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.
Jim Lehrer : Governor Clinton, you have 1 minute.
Bill Clinton : Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.
Bill Clinton : And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.
Bill Clinton : It was a remarkable event.
Bill Clinton : But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.
Bill Clinton : In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.
Bill Clinton : All right, the war's over; we know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel.
Bill Clinton : Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.
Bill Clinton : But in late '89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations.
Bill Clinton : So I think what was wrong -- I give credit where credit is due -- but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. President, you have a moment -- a minute, I'm sorry.
George Bush : Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight.
George Bush : We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.
George Bush : All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that.
George Bush : And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand.
George Bush : And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.
George Bush : And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.
George Bush : And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.
George Bush : And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.
George Bush : And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.
George Bush : Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.
George Bush : (APPLAUSE)
George Bush : And so I just have to say, it's fine.
George Bush : You can't stand there, Governor Clinton, and say, well, I think I'd have been -- I have supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it would go away -- but I would have voted with the majority.
George Bush : Come on, that's not leadership.
Jim Lehrer : All right, the next question goes to Governor Clinton, and Gene Gibbons will ask it.
Jim Lehrer : Gene?
Gene Gibbons : Governor, an important aspect of leadership is, of course, anticipating problems.
Gene Gibbons : During the 1988 campaign there was little or no mention of the savings and loan crisis that has cost the American people billions and billions of dollars.
Gene Gibbons : Now there are rumblings that a commercial bank crisis is on the horizon.
Gene Gibbons : Is there such a problem, sir?
Gene Gibbons : If so, how bad is it and what will it cost to clean it up?
Bill Clinton : Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks, and on December 19th new regulations will go into effect which will in effect give the government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble.
Bill Clinton : On the other hand, I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis.
Bill Clinton : The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.
Bill Clinton : Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.
Bill Clinton : The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks.
Bill Clinton : I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways.
Bill Clinton : We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.
Bill Clinton : We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not.
Bill Clinton : And that will be my policy.
Bill Clinton : And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact.
Bill Clinton : It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was.
Jim Lehrer : President Bush, one minute.
George Bush : Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.
George Bush : It is sound.
George Bush : There are some problem banks out there.
George Bush : But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.
George Bush : And I have proposed that.
George Bush : And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn't put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound.
George Bush : But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, 1 minute.
Ross Perot : Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.
Ross Perot : The whole problem came up in 1984.
Ross Perot : The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.
Ross Perot : These crooks -- now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was.
Ross Perot : Now, in 1984 they were told.
Ross Perot : I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.
Ross Perot : Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money.
Ross Perot : Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.
Ross Perot : And they buried it till right after the election.
Ross Perot : Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.
Ross Perot : Now, if that's true, just tell me now.
Ross Perot : I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.
Ross Perot : But just tell me now; don't bury until after the election twice.
Ross Perot : I say that to both political parties.
Ross Perot : The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.
Ross Perot : Just tell us.
Jim Lehrer : All right, Mr. Perot, the next question -- we're going into a new round here on a category just called differences, and the question goes to you, Mr. Perot, and Gene will ask it.
Jim Lehrer : Gene?
Gene Gibbons : Mr. Perot, aside from the deficit, what government policy or policies do you really want to do something about?
Gene Gibbons : What really sticks in your craw about conditions in this country -- beside the deficit -- that you would want to fix as president?
Ross Perot : The debt and the deficit.
Ross Perot : Well, if you watched my television show the other night, you saw it.
Ross Perot : And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more.
Ross Perot : A shameless plug there, Mr. President.
Ross Perot : But in a nutshell we've got to reform our government or we won't get anything done.
Ross Perot : We have a government that doesn't work.
Ross Perot : All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.
Ross Perot : We have a government that doesn't work.
Ross Perot : It's supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people.
Ross Perot : The people need to take their government back.
Ross Perot : You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.
Ross Perot : We've got to turn this thing around.
Ross Perot : And it's a long list of specific items.
Ross Perot : And I've covered it again and again in print and on television.
Ross Perot : But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.
Ross Perot : Who can give themselves a 23% pay raise anywhere in the world except Congress?
Ross Perot : Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in?
Ross Perot : I don't have a free reserved parking place at Natl Airport, why should my servants?
Ross Perot : I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don't have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time.
Ross Perot : And I'm paying for all that for those guys.
Ross Perot : I'm going to be running an ad pretty soon that shows they promised us they were going to hold the line on spending at the tax and budget summit, and I'm going to show how much they've increased this little stuff they do for themselves.
Ross Perot : And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it.
Ross Perot : Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up.
Ross Perot : You say, how can I get Congress to do that?
Ross Perot : I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong.
Ross Perot : We've turned the country upside down.
Ross Perot : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Governor Clinton, you have one minute.
Jim Lehrer : Governor?
Bill Clinton : I would just point out, on the point Mr. Perot made, I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress.
Bill Clinton : I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.
Bill Clinton : But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.
Bill Clinton : Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.
Bill Clinton : That, however, is not my only passion.
Bill Clinton : The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind.
Bill Clinton : My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans and to make sure we've got the best trained workforce in the world.
Bill Clinton : That is my passion.
Bill Clinton : We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit.
Bill Clinton : Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : President Bush, one minute.
George Bush : On government reform?
Jim Lehrer : Sir?
George Bush : Government reform?
Jim Lehrer : Yes, exactly.
Jim Lehrer : Well, to respond to the subject that Mr. Perot mentioned.
George Bush : Well, how about this for a government reform policy?
George Bush : Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.
George Bush : Term limits for members of the US Congress.
George Bush : Give the government back to the people.
George Bush : Let's do it that way.
George Bush : The president has term limits.
George Bush : Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.
George Bush : (APPLAUSE)
George Bush : Term limits.
George Bush : And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?
George Bush : Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.
George Bush : Let's try that.
George Bush : And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?
George Bush : Okay.
George Bush : How about a line item veto?
George Bush : Forty-three governors have that.
George Bush : And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.
George Bush : A line item veto.
George Bush : That means you can take a line and cut out some of the pork out of a meaningful bill.
George Bush : Governor Clinton keeps hitting me on vetoing legislation.
George Bush : Well, that's the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there, and I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage.
George Bush : Line item veto -- there's a good reform program for you.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Next question goes to Governor Clinton.
Jim Lehrer : You have 2 minutes, Governor, and Susan will ask it.
Susan Rook : Governor Clinton, you said that you will raise taxes on the rich, people with incomes of $200,000 a year or higher.
Susan Rook : A lot of people are saying that you will have to go lower than that, much lower.
Susan Rook : Will you make a pledge tonight below which, an income level that you will not go below?
Susan Rook : I'm looking for numbers, sir, not just a concept.
Bill Clinton : My plan -- you can read my plan.
Bill Clinton : My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent, that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations play (sic) in America, that we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies, and for middle class tax relief.
Bill Clinton : Now, I'll tell ya this.
Bill Clinton : I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.
Bill Clinton : If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.
Bill Clinton : I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.
Bill Clinton : "Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."
Bill Clinton : And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.
Bill Clinton : "So I think even he has learned that you can't say ""read my lips"" because you can't know what emergencies might come up."
Bill Clinton : But I can tell you this.
Bill Clinton : I'm not gonna raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for the programs I've recommended.
Bill Clinton : Read my plan.
Bill Clinton : And you know how you can trust me about that?
Bill Clinton : Because you know, in the first debate, Mr. Bush made some news.
Bill Clinton : He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.
Bill Clinton : Well, I'll tell ya.
Bill Clinton : I'll make some news in the 3rd debate.
Bill Clinton : The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton.
Bill Clinton : I'm gonna make those decisions, and I won't raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : President Bush, you have one minute.
George Bush : That's what worries me --
George Bush : (Laughter and applause)
George Bush : -- that he's going to be responsible.
George Bush : He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.
George Bush : He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.
George Bush : We do not want to be the lowest of the low.
George Bush : We are not a nation in decline.
George Bush : (APPLAUSE)
George Bush : We are a rising nation.
George Bush : Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.
George Bush : He said I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich.
George Bush : To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that's making $36,600.
George Bush : And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you're going to sock it to the working man.
George Bush : "So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet."
George Bush : Lock your wallet because he's coming right after you just like Jimmy Carter did and just like you're going to get -- you're going to end up with interest rates at 21%, and you're going to have inflation going through the roof.
George Bush : Yes, we're having tough times, but we do not need to go back to the failed policies of the past, when you had a Democratic president and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.
George Bush : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot.
Bill Clinton : Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.
Bill Clinton : What about the honor of my state?
Bill Clinton : We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.
Bill Clinton : And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that we're going in the right direction and this country's going in the wrong direction.
Bill Clinton : And I have to defend the honor of my state.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : We've got a wash, according to my calculation.
Jim Lehrer : We have a wash. And we go to Mr. Perot for one minute.
Jim Lehrer : In other words, it's a violation of the rule, that's what I meant, Mr. Perot.
Ross Perot : So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?
Jim Lehrer : That's right.
Jim Lehrer : You're clear.
Jim Lehrer : (Laughter and applause)
Ross Perot : I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.
Ross Perot : (Laughter)
Ross Perot : Key thing here, see, we all come up with images.
Ross Perot : Images don't fix anything.
Ross Perot : I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.
Ross Perot : You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.
Ross Perot : If you've been on television about it, you think you did it.
Ross Perot : (Laughter)
Ross Perot : What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.
Ross Perot : Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work.
Ross Perot : The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up.
Ross Perot : And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.
Ross Perot : So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.
Ross Perot : I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.
Ross Perot : And it's fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children.
Ross Perot : And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : This is the last question, and it goes to President Bush for a 2-minute answer.
Jim Lehrer : And it will be asked by Helen.
Helen Thomas : Mr. President, why have you dropped so dramatically in the leadership polls, from the high 80s to the 40s?
Helen Thomas : And you have said that you will do anything you have to do to get reelected.
Helen Thomas : What can you do in 2 weeks to win reelection?
George Bush : Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.
George Bush : Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.
George Bush : Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest.
George Bush : It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.
George Bush : We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way.
George Bush : And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride.
George Bush : On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine.
George Bush : But he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts.
George Bush : They're almost at the bottom on every single category.
George Bush : We can't do that to the American people.
George Bush : And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.
George Bush : And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.
George Bush : It doesn't work that way when you're president.
George Bush : Truman is right.
George Bush : The buck stops there.
George Bush : And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.
George Bush : And I've done that.
George Bush : It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.
George Bush : So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.
George Bush : And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.
George Bush : And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.
George Bush : Also I got a philosophical difference.
George Bush : I got to watch the clock here.
George Bush : I don't think we're a declining nation.
George Bush : The whole world has had economic problems.
George Bush : We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.
George Bush : And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, you have --
George Bush : That's why I think I'll win.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot -- sorry, excuse me, sir.
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, you have one minute.
Ross Perot : I'm the last one, right?
Jim Lehrer : No, Governor Clinton has a minute after you.
Jim Lehrer : Then we have the closing statements.
Ross Perot : One minute after you.
Jim Lehrer : Right.
Ross Perot : I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.
Ross Perot : I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.
Ross Perot : I'm totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.
Ross Perot : So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.
Ross Perot : And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.
Ross Perot : Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?
Ross Perot : They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.
Ross Perot : We have an adversarial relationship that's destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world.
Ross Perot : Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.
Ross Perot : It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.
Jim Lehrer : Governor Clinton, one minute.
Bill Clinton : "I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed."
Bill Clinton : But the main thing is he still didn't get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond.
Bill Clinton : They don't want us talking about each other.
Bill Clinton : They want us to talk about the problems of this country.
Bill Clinton : I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not true.
Bill Clinton : Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me.
Bill Clinton : High tech executives in Northern California.
Bill Clinton : Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.
Bill Clinton : Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.
Bill Clinton : We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : Now, that was the final question and answer and we now go to the closing statements.
Jim Lehrer : Each candidate will have up to 2 minutes.
Jim Lehrer : The order was determined by a drawing.
Jim Lehrer : Governor Clinton, you're first.
Jim Lehrer : Governor.
Bill Clinton : First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.
Bill Clinton : I think the real winners of the debates were the American people.
Bill Clinton : I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions.
Bill Clinton : They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.
Bill Clinton : I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.
Bill Clinton : I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.
Bill Clinton : I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well.
Bill Clinton : I just believe it's time to change.
Bill Clinton : I offer a new approach.
Bill Clinton : It's not trickle down economics.
Bill Clinton : It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.
Bill Clinton : More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.
Bill Clinton : We can do better.
Bill Clinton : And it's not tax and spend economics.
Bill Clinton : It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy.
Bill Clinton : That is my commitment to you.
Bill Clinton : It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.
Bill Clinton : I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.
Bill Clinton : I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income.
Bill Clinton : I know we can do better.
Bill Clinton : It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.
Bill Clinton : Thank you very much.
Bill Clinton : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : President Bush, your closing statement, sir.
George Bush : Three weeks from now -- 2 weeks from tomorrow, America goes to the polls and you're going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery.
George Bush : On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.
George Bush : I don't believe in trickle-down government, I don't believe in larger taxes and larger government spending.
George Bush : On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.
George Bush : I believe it's not.
George Bush : We're living in an interconnected world.
George Bush : The whole world is having economic difficulties.
George Bush : The US is doing better than a lot.
George Bush : But we've got to do even better.
George Bush : And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?
George Bush : And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said it's not the character of the president but the character of the presidency.
George Bush : I couldn't disagree more.
George Bush : Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.
George Bush : And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word.
George Bush : And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?
George Bush : I need your support, I ask for your vote.
George Bush : And may God bless the US of America.
George Bush : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Mr. Perot, your closing statement, sir.
Ross Perot : To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.
Ross Perot : These next 2 weeks we will be going full steam ahead to make sure that you get a voice and that you get your country back.
Ross Perot : This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.
Ross Perot : Now, the question is, can we win?
Ross Perot : Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.
Ross Perot : Question really is who do you want in the White House.
Ross Perot : It's that simple.
Ross Perot : Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.
Ross Perot : (APPLAUSE)
Ross Perot : Then the question is, can we govern?
Ross Perot : I love that one.
Ross Perot : "The ""we"" is you and me."
Ross Perot : You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.
Ross Perot : And, believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also.
Ross Perot : Together we can get anything done.
Ross Perot : The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.
Ross Perot : Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.
Ross Perot : Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?
Ross Perot : Make your decision and vote on November the 3rd.
Ross Perot : I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs.
Ross Perot : Who's the best person to manage money?
Ross Perot : I suggest you pick a person who's successfully managed money.
Ross Perot : Who's the best person to get results and not talk?
Ross Perot : Look at the record and make your decision.
Ross Perot : And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?
Ross Perot : And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?
Ross Perot : Finally, to you students up there -- God bless you, I'm doing this for you: I want you to have the American dream.
Ross Perot : (APPLAUSE)
Ross Perot : To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.
Ross Perot : That's it.
Ross Perot : Thank you very much.
Ross Perot : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : All right, thank you, Mr. Perot; thank you, Mr. President; thank you, Governor Clinton -- for being with us tonight and in the previous debates.
Jim Lehrer : Thank you to the panel.
Jim Lehrer : The only thing that is left to be said is, from Michigan State University in East Lansing, I'm Jim Lehrer, thank you and good night.
Jim Lehrer : (APPLAUSE)
