Jim Lehrer : Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford.
Jim Lehrer : I'm Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.
Jim Lehrer : The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October.
Jim Lehrer : Tonight's will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis.
Jim Lehrer : It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments.
Jim Lehrer : Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss.
Jim Lehrer : The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me.
Jim Lehrer : They have not been shared or cleared with anyone.
Jim Lehrer : The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain.
Jim Lehrer : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign.
Jim Lehrer : "Quote, ""We must achieve both security and solvency."
Jim Lehrer : "In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,"" end quote."
Jim Lehrer : With that in mind, the first lead question.
Jim Lehrer : Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan?
Jim Lehrer : First response to you, Senator Obama.
Jim Lehrer : You have two minutes.
Barack Obama : Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.
Barack Obama : I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.
Barack Obama : You know, we are at a defining moment in our history.
Barack Obama : Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Barack Obama : And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.
Barack Obama : And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?
Barack Obama : How's it going to affect my job?
Barack Obama : How's it going to affect my house?
Barack Obama : How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?
Barack Obama : So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.
Barack Obama : And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.
Barack Obama : Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.
Barack Obama : Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.
Barack Obama : Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.
Barack Obama : And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.
Barack Obama : Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.
Barack Obama : It hasn't worked.
Barack Obama : And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.
Barack Obama : That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.
Jim Lehrer : Senator McCain, two minutes.
John McCain : Well, thank you, Jim.
John McCain : And thanks to everybody.
John McCain : And I do have a sad note tonight.
John McCain : Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.
John McCain : He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us.
John McCain : Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.
John McCain : I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.
John McCain : And, Jim, I -- I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately.
John McCain : So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.
John McCain : But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why.
John McCain : Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.
John McCain : And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis.
John McCain : And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street.
John McCain : We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while.
John McCain : But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.
John McCain : This package has transparency in it.
John McCain : It has to have accountability and oversight.
John McCain : It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans.
John McCain : We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.
John McCain : And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives.
John McCain : And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that.
John McCain : And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.
John McCain : But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.
John McCain : This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis.
John McCain : This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.
John McCain : And we've got a lot of work to do.
John McCain : And we've got to create jobs.
John McCain : And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.
Jim Lehrer : All right, let's go back to my question.
Jim Lehrer : How do you all stand on the recovery plan?
Jim Lehrer : And talk to each other about it.
Jim Lehrer : We've got five minutes.
Jim Lehrer : We can negotiate a deal right here.
Jim Lehrer : But, I mean, are you -- do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain?
Jim Lehrer : Do you -- are you in favor of this plan?
Barack Obama : We haven't seen the language yet.
Barack Obama : And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.
Barack Obama : So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.
Barack Obama : The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?
Barack Obama : Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.
Barack Obama : Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.
Barack Obama : So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.
Barack Obama : And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.
Barack Obama : But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?
Barack Obama : We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.
Barack Obama : And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.
Jim Lehrer : Are you going to vote for the plan, Senator McCain?
John McCain : I -- I hope so.
John McCain : And I...
Jim Lehrer : As a United States senator...
John McCain : Sure.
Jim Lehrer : ... you're going to vote for the plan?
John McCain : Sure.
John McCain : But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.
John McCain : A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.
John McCain : But there's also the issue of responsibility.
John McCain : You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.
John McCain : President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.
John McCain : One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.
John McCain : And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.
John McCain : Somehow we've lost that accountability.
John McCain : I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
John McCain : We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.
John McCain : But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.
John McCain : As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.
John McCain : And I promise you that that will happen.
Jim Lehrer : Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?
Barack Obama : Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.
Barack Obama : I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street.
Barack Obama : And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.
Barack Obama : And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.
Jim Lehrer : Say it directly to him.
Barack Obama : I do not think that they are.
Jim Lehrer : Say it directly to him.
Barack Obama : Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.
Barack Obama : And...
John McCain : Are you afraid I couldn't hear him?
John McCain : (LAUGHTER)
Jim Lehrer : I'm just determined to get you all to talk to each other.
Jim Lehrer : I'm going to try.
Barack Obama : The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.
Barack Obama : And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on.
Barack Obama : They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.
Barack Obama : We haven't been paying attention to them.
Barack Obama : And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.
Jim Lehrer : So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said?
Jim Lehrer : And, if you don't, tell him what you disagree with.
John McCain : No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system.
John McCain : We've got fundamental problems in the system.
John McCain : And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.
John McCain : So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go.
John McCain : And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.
John McCain : But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker.
John McCain : And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.
John McCain : America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.
John McCain : But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America.
John McCain : And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.
Jim Lehrer : All right, let's go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject.
Jim Lehrer : And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain.
Jim Lehrer : "And using your word ""fundamental,"" are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama's approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?"
John McCain : Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.
John McCain : It's completely out of control.
John McCain : It's gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society.
John McCain : We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us.
John McCain : And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway.
John McCain : It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.
John McCain : And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.
John McCain : You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.
John McCain : I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.
John McCain : And it has got to be brought under control.
John McCain : As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen.
John McCain : This one's kind of old.
John McCain : I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk.
John McCain : I will make them famous.
John McCain : You will know their names.
John McCain : Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.
John McCain : He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.
John McCain : I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects.
John McCain : That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.
Jim Lehrer : Senator Obama, two minutes.
Barack Obama : Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.
Barack Obama : And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.
Barack Obama : But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.
Barack Obama : Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.
Barack Obama : Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.
Barack Obama : And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.
Barack Obama : So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.
Barack Obama : What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.
Barack Obama : And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.
Barack Obama : And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.
Jim Lehrer : Senator McCain?
John McCain : Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...
John McCain : (CROSSTALK)
Jim Lehrer : No, that's fine.
John McCain : Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.
John McCain : He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.
John McCain : Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money.
John McCain : But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.
John McCain : """It's only $18 billion."""
John McCain : Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?
John McCain : Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people?
John McCain : It corrupts people.
John McCain : That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.
John McCain : It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.
John McCain : I have fought against it my career.
John McCain : I have fought against it.
John McCain : I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.
John McCain : I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.
John McCain : Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.
John McCain : Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.
John McCain : I want to cut spending.
John McCain : I want to keep taxes low.
John McCain : The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.
Barack Obama : I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures.
Barack Obama : Let's just be clear.
Barack Obama : What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States.
Barack Obama : I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.
Barack Obama : I think those are pretty important priorities.
Barack Obama : And I pay for every dime of it.
Barack Obama : But let's go back to the original point.
Barack Obama : John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.
Barack Obama : And, absolutely, we need earmark reform.
Barack Obama : And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.
Barack Obama : But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.
Barack Obama : And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.
Jim Lehrer : Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the -- he's made it twice now, about your tax -- your policies about tax cuts.
John McCain : Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.
John McCain : Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.
John McCain : Ireland pays 11 percent.
John McCain : Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.
John McCain : I want to cut that business tax.
John McCain : I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.
John McCain : But, again, I want to return.
John McCain : It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.
John McCain : I can tell you, it's rife.
John McCain : It's throughout.
John McCain : The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.
John McCain : Look at them.
John McCain : You'll be appalled.
John McCain : And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.
John McCain : So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts.
John McCain : I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.
John McCain : I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.
John McCain : "I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich."""
Jim Lehrer : Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that?
Barack Obama : Well, let me just make a couple of points.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Barack Obama : My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.
Barack Obama : And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.
Barack Obama : Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.
Barack Obama : Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.
Barack Obama : And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.
Barack Obama : It's not like you want to close the loopholes.
Barack Obama : You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.
Barack Obama : And that's a problem.
Barack Obama : Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.
Barack Obama : Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.
Barack Obama : So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.
Barack Obama : Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.
Barack Obama : And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.
Barack Obama : It is not a good deal for the American people.
Barack Obama : But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.
John McCain : Well, you know, let me just...
Jim Lehrer : We've got to go to another lead question.
John McCain : I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.
John McCain : We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.
John McCain : It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments.
John McCain : It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.
John McCain : I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.
Barack Obama : John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.
John McCain : You've got to look at our record.
John McCain : You've got to look at our records.
John McCain : That's the important thing.
John McCain : Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending?
John McCain : Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?
John McCain : Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?
John McCain : And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.
John McCain : Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.
John McCain : And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill.
John McCain : But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions.
John McCain : He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.
Barack Obama : That's not true, John.
Barack Obama : That's not true.
John McCain : And that's just a fact.
John McCain : Again, you can look it up.
Barack Obama : Look, it's just not true.
Barack Obama : And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.
Barack Obama : Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.
Barack Obama : But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.
Barack Obama : And...
John McCain : With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.
Barack Obama : No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out.
Barack Obama : We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue -- the financial rescue thing that we started -- started asking about.
Jim Lehrer : And what -- and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama.
Jim Lehrer : As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is it's going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?
Barack Obama : Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.
Barack Obama : We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.
Barack Obama : The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.
Barack Obama : But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.
Barack Obama : There are some things that I think have to be done.
Barack Obama : We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.
Barack Obama : We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families.
Barack Obama : Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.
Barack Obama : They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.
Barack Obama : I'm meeting folks all over the country.
Barack Obama : We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.
Barack Obama : The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.
Barack Obama : We've got to invest in science and technology.
Barack Obama : China had a space launch and a space walk.
Barack Obama : We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.
Barack Obama : And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.
Barack Obama : And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.
Barack Obama : Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.
Barack Obama : So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.
Barack Obama : We can't shortchange those things.
Barack Obama : We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.
Jim Lehrer : Are you -- what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the -- because of the financial bailout cost?
John McCain : Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending.
John McCain : We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control.
John McCain : Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.
John McCain : It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.
John McCain : The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.
John McCain : First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies.
John McCain : I oppose ethanol subsidies.
John McCain : I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts.
John McCain : We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.
John McCain : We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it.
John McCain : So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.
John McCain : We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.
John McCain : I know how to do that.
John McCain : I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.
John McCain : And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.
John McCain : But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.
Jim Lehrer : But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout?
Jim Lehrer : Is that what you're saying?
Barack Obama : No.
Barack Obama : As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...
Jim Lehrer : Like what?
Barack Obama : ... deferred and delayed.
Barack Obama : Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.
Barack Obama : That is a big project.
Barack Obama : That is a multi-year project.
Jim Lehrer : Not willing to give that up?
Barack Obama : Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.
Barack Obama : But John is right we have to make cuts.
Barack Obama : We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.
Barack Obama : Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.
Barack Obama : They just skim off $15 billion.
Barack Obama : That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.
Barack Obama : They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.
Barack Obama : Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.
Barack Obama : Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.
Jim Lehrer : What I'm trying to get at this is this.
Jim Lehrer : Excuse me if I may, senator.
Jim Lehrer : Trying to get at that you all -- one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January.
Jim Lehrer : At the -- in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved.
Jim Lehrer : And what I'm trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific -- small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency.
John McCain : How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.
Jim Lehrer : Spending freeze?
John McCain : I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.
Jim Lehrer : Would you go for that?
Barack Obama : The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.
Barack Obama : There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.
Barack Obama : I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense.
Barack Obama : Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.
Barack Obama : We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.
Barack Obama : It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.
John McCain : Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much.
John McCain : Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.
John McCain : We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.
John McCain : Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.
John McCain : You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030.
John McCain : Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned.
John McCain : An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.
Jim Lehrer : Before we go to another lead question.
Jim Lehrer : Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here.
Jim Lehrer : Are you -- are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already -- I mean, is it a major move?
Jim Lehrer : Is it going to have a major affect?
Barack Obama : There's no doubt it˘âĴâ˘s gonna affect our budgets.
Barack Obama : There is no doubt about it.
Barack Obama : Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.
Barack Obama : If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.
Barack Obama : And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision.
Barack Obama : The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.
John McCain : Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan.
John McCain : I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors.
John McCain : Not the federal government.
John McCain : Look.
John McCain : We have to obviously cut spending.
John McCain : I have fought to cut spending.
John McCain : Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.
John McCain : I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.
John McCain : We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.
John McCain : And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.
John McCain : And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control.
John McCain : We owe China $500 billion.
John McCain : And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career.
John McCain : And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.
Barack Obama : I just want to make this point, Jim.
Barack Obama : John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.
Barack Obama : This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.
Barack Obama : So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.
Jim Lehrer : Quick response to Senator Obama.
John McCain : It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration.
John McCain : I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.
John McCain : On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.
John McCain : I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : Let's go another subject.
Jim Lehrer : Lead question, two minutes to you, senator McCain.
Jim Lehrer : Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam.
Jim Lehrer : What do you see as the lessons of Iraq?
John McCain : I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.
John McCain : Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated.
John McCain : And then the war was very badly mishandled.
John McCain : I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.
John McCain : This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it.
John McCain : And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.
John McCain : This strategy has succeeded.
John McCain : And we are winning in Iraq.
John McCain : And we will come home with victory and with honor.
John McCain : And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.
John McCain : And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.
John McCain : The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.
John McCain : It would have been increase in sectarian violence.
John McCain : It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.
John McCain : So there was a lot at stake there.
John McCain : And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.
John McCain : And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home.
John McCain : And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.
Jim Lehrer : Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama.
Barack Obama : Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.
Barack Obama : Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.
Barack Obama : We hadn't caught bin Laden.
Barack Obama : We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.
Barack Obama : Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.
Barack Obama : And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case.
Barack Obama : We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.
Barack Obama : We have lost over 4,000 lives.
Barack Obama : We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.
Barack Obama : We took our eye off the ball.
Barack Obama : And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.
Barack Obama : So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.
Barack Obama : But we have to use our military wisely.
Barack Obama : And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.
Jim Lehrer : Do you agree with that, the lesson of Iraq?
John McCain : The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.
John McCain : The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind.
John McCain : That's the decision of the next president of the United States.
John McCain : Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure.
John McCain : Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.
John McCain : But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.
John McCain : Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.
Jim Lehrer : Well, let's go at some of these things...
John McCain : Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan.
John McCain : To this day, he has never had a hearing.
Jim Lehrer : What about that point?
John McCain : I mean, it's remarkable.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Jim Lehrer : What about that point?
Barack Obama : Which point?
Barack Obama : He raised a whole bunch of them.
Jim Lehrer : I know, OK, let's go to the latter point and we'll back up.
Jim Lehrer : The point about your not having been...
Barack Obama : Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole.
Barack Obama : But that's Senate inside baseball.
Barack Obama : But let's get back to the core issue here.
Barack Obama : Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.
Barack Obama : They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.
Barack Obama : But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.
Barack Obama : And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.
Barack Obama : You talk about the surge.
Barack Obama : The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.
Barack Obama : You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.
Barack Obama : You were wrong.
Barack Obama : You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.
Barack Obama : You were wrong.
Barack Obama : You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni.
Barack Obama : And you were wrong.
Barack Obama : And so my question is...
Barack Obama : (CROSSTALK)
Jim Lehrer : Senator Obama...
Barack Obama : ... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.
Jim Lehrer : I have got a lot on the plate here...
John McCain : I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.
John McCain : But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad.
John McCain : General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.
John McCain : I was honored to be there.
John McCain : I was honored to speak to those troops.
John McCain : And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.
John McCain : And you know what they said to us?
John McCain : They said, let us win.
John McCain : They said, let us win.
John McCain : We don't want our kids coming back here.
John McCain : And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.
John McCain : Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.
Barack Obama : That's not true.
John McCain : They just passed an electoral...
Barack Obama : That's not true.
John McCain : An election law just in the last few days.
John McCain : There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.
John McCain : They inform on the bad guys.
John McCain : And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.
John McCain : That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.
Jim Lehrer : Let me see...
Barack Obama : Jim, Jim, this is a big...
John McCain : It was a strategy.
John McCain : And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general.
John McCain : And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Barack Obama : Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.
Barack Obama : First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.
Barack Obama : Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.
Barack Obama : I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.
Barack Obama : We had a difference on the timetable.
Barack Obama : We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.
Barack Obama : We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.
Barack Obama : And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.
Barack Obama : The question is, was this wise?
Barack Obama : We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.
Barack Obama : We need more troops there.
Barack Obama : We need more resources there.
Barack Obama : Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?
Barack Obama : We've been successful in Afghanistan.
Barack Obama : There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.
Barack Obama : This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.
Barack Obama : Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.
Barack Obama : But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.
Barack Obama : Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly.
Barack Obama : We should do it in phases.
Barack Obama : But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.
Barack Obama : And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.
John McCain : Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America.
Barack Obama : That's not the case.
John McCain : That's what ...
Barack Obama : What he said was a precipitous...
John McCain : That's what Admiral Mullen said.
Barack Obama : ... withdrawal would be dangerous.
Barack Obama : He did not say that.
Barack Obama : That's not true.
John McCain : And also General Petraeus said the same thing.
John McCain : Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.
John McCain : Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.
John McCain : And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.
John McCain : It didn't exceed beyond mine, because I know that that's a strategy that has worked and can succeed.
John McCain : But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.
Jim Lehrer : Afghanistan, lead -- a new -- a new lead question.
Jim Lehrer : Now, having resolved Iraq, we'll move to Afghanistan.
Jim Lehrer : (LAUGHTER)
Jim Lehrer : And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and it's a -- it picks up on a point that's already been made.
Jim Lehrer : Do you think more troops -- more U.S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?
Barack Obama : Yes, I think we need more troops.
Barack Obama : I've been saying that for over a year now.
Barack Obama : And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.
Barack Obama : We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.
Barack Obama : And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.
Barack Obama : They are feeling emboldened.
Barack Obama : And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.
Barack Obama : So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.
Barack Obama : Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.
Barack Obama : And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.
Barack Obama : So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.
Barack Obama : It's not just more troops.
Barack Obama : We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.
Barack Obama : And I've said this to President Karzai.
Barack Obama : Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.
Barack Obama : Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.
Barack Obama : And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.
Jim Lehrer : Afghanistan, Senator McCain?
John McCain : First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.
John McCain : And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today.
John McCain : So we can't ignore those lessons of history.
John McCain : Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.
John McCain : I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.
John McCain : So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.
John McCain : We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.
John McCain : He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.
John McCain : Now, you don't do that.
John McCain : You don't say that out loud.
John McCain : If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.
John McCain : Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full.
John McCain : And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.
John McCain : I've been to Waziristan.
John McCain : I can see how tough that terrain is.
John McCain : It's ruled by a handful of tribes.
John McCain : And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq.
John McCain : It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.
John McCain : And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.
John McCain : And it's going to be tough.
John McCain : They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban.
John McCain : And it's going to be tough.
John McCain : But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.
John McCain : And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.
John McCain : So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.
John McCain : But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.
John McCain : So it's not just the addition of troops that matters.
John McCain : It's a strategy that will succeed.
John McCain : And Pakistan is a very important element in this.
John McCain : And I know how to work with them.
John McCain : And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.
Barack Obama : Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.
Barack Obama : Here's what I said.
Barack Obama : And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.
Barack Obama : Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.
Barack Obama : And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.
Barack Obama : But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.
Barack Obama : I think this is the right strategy.
Barack Obama : Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.
Barack Obama : This is not an easy situation.
Barack Obama : You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.
Barack Obama : And we've got a choice.
Barack Obama : We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.
Barack Obama : And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.
Barack Obama : "We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."""
Barack Obama : And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.
Barack Obama : We spent $10 billion.
Barack Obama : And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.
Barack Obama : That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.
John McCain : I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.
John McCain : Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.
John McCain : But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.
John McCain : Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.
John McCain : And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference.
John McCain : Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.
John McCain : And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.
John McCain : I supported -- I supported that.
John McCain : I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia.
John McCain : That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.
John McCain : I supported what we did in Kosovo.
John McCain : I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.
John McCain : And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.
John McCain : So I have a record.
John McCain : I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way.
John McCain : "And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""
John McCain : He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year.
John McCain : This was last August, a year ago.
John McCain : "And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."""
John McCain : And this was August, a year ago.
John McCain : "And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain."""
John McCain : That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.
John McCain : And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.
John McCain : I know what that˘âĴâ˘s like when an army is defeated.
John McCain : A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated.
John McCain : And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.
John McCain : And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.
Barack Obama : Jim, let me just make a point.
Barack Obama : I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.
Barack Obama : She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.
Barack Obama : No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.
Barack Obama : And we honor all the service that they've provided.
Barack Obama : Our troops have performed brilliantly.
Barack Obama : The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.
Barack Obama : And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.
Barack Obama : And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.
Barack Obama : "At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan."
Barack Obama : You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.
Barack Obama : You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.
Barack Obama : I think that is something we have to take seriously.
Barack Obama : And when I'm president, I will.
Jim Lehrer : New ...
John McCain : You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.
John McCain : By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.
John McCain : But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.
John McCain : I know what our needs are.
John McCain : So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.
John McCain : But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.
John McCain : Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.
Jim Lehrer : I have some good news and bad news for the two of you.
Jim Lehrer : You all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering we've been going at it ...
Barack Obama : A testimony to you, Jim.
Jim Lehrer : I don't know about that.
Jim Lehrer : But the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, we'll adjust as we get there.
Jim Lehrer : But the amount of time is even.
Jim Lehrer : New lead question.
Jim Lehrer : And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States?
John McCain : My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.
John McCain : Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.
John McCain : Let's just make that very clear.
John McCain : What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk.
John McCain : The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.
John McCain : I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world's economic power.
John McCain : We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.
John McCain : The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.
John McCain : So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.
John McCain : But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.
John McCain : And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.
John McCain : What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran.
John McCain : There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror.
John McCain : Senator Obama said that would be provocative.
John McCain : So this is a serious threat.
John McCain : This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.
Jim Lehrer : Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.
Barack Obama : Well, let me just correct something very quickly.
Barack Obama : I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.
Barack Obama : I've consistently said so.
Barack Obama : What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq.
Barack Obama : To deal with Iran.
Barack Obama : And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.
Barack Obama : Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.
Barack Obama : That was cleared away.
Barack Obama : And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.
Barack Obama : They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.
Barack Obama : So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.
Barack Obama : Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran.
Barack Obama : It would be a game changer.
Barack Obama : Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.
Barack Obama : Now here's what we need to do.
Barack Obama : We do need tougher sanctions.
Barack Obama : I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.
Barack Obama : But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.
Barack Obama : It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.
Barack Obama : In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.
Barack Obama : That will change when I'm president of the United States.
Jim Lehrer : Senator, what about talking?
John McCain : Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition.
John McCain : Without precondition.
John McCain : Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.
John McCain : The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.
John McCain : Or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went.
John McCain : Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.
John McCain : Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.
John McCain : Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.
Barack Obama : So let's talk about this.
Barack Obama : First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.
Barack Obama : So he may not be the right person to talk to.
Barack Obama : But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.
Barack Obama : And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.
Barack Obama : Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.
Barack Obama : This is one of your own advisers.
Barack Obama : "Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions."""
Barack Obama : It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.
Barack Obama : "What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you."""
Barack Obama : There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.
Barack Obama : Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.
Barack Obama : But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.
Barack Obama : And you know what?
Barack Obama : President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.
Barack Obama : Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.
Barack Obama : And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks.
Barack Obama : They're a member of the axis of evil.
Barack Obama : We can't deal with them.
Barack Obama : And you know what happened?
Barack Obama : They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.
Barack Obama : They tested a nuke.
Barack Obama : They tested missiles.
Barack Obama : They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.
Barack Obama : And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.
Barack Obama : When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.
Barack Obama : And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.
Barack Obama : He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.
Barack Obama : I mean, Spain?
Barack Obama : Spain is a NATO ally.
John McCain : Of course.
Barack Obama : If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.
John McCain : I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.
John McCain : I don't even have a seal yet.
John McCain : Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad.
John McCain : He did not say that.
Barack Obama : Of course not.
John McCain : He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.
John McCain : I've always encouraged them.
John McCain : The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.
John McCain : "What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a ""stinking corpse,"" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments."
John McCain : This is dangerous.
John McCain : It isn't just naive; it's dangerous.
John McCain : And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.
John McCain : As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea.
John McCain : By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.
John McCain : The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.
John McCain : We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.
John McCain : "And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's ""trust, but verify,"" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous."
Barack Obama : Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.
Barack Obama : Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it.
Barack Obama : This is a mischaracterization of my position.
Barack Obama : When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.
Barack Obama : And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.
Barack Obama : And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.
Barack Obama : Nobody is even talking about that.
John McCain : So let me get this right.
John McCain : "We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"
John McCain : Oh, please.
Barack Obama : No, let me tell...
Barack Obama : (CROSSTALK)
John McCain : By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.
John McCain : I've known him for 35 years.
Barack Obama : We will take a look.
John McCain : And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.
Barack Obama : Nobody's talking about that.
John McCain : Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.
John McCain : We do that all the time.
Jim Lehrer : We're going to go to a new...
Jim Lehrer : (CROSSTALK)
John McCain : And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.
Barack Obama : I am not parsing words.
John McCain : He's parsing words, my friends.
Barack Obama : I'm using the same words that your advisers use.
Barack Obama : Please, go ahead.
Jim Lehrer : New lead question.
Jim Lehrer : Russia, goes to you, two minutes, Senator Obama.
Jim Lehrer : How do you see the relationship with Russia?
Jim Lehrer : Do you see them as a competitor?
Jim Lehrer : Do you see them as an enemy?
Jim Lehrer : Do you see them as a potential partner?
Barack Obama : Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.
Barack Obama : Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.
Barack Obama : They were unwarranted.
Barack Obama : And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.
Barack Obama : They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Barack Obama : It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.
Barack Obama : And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts.
Barack Obama : They are members of NATO.
Barack Obama : And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.
Barack Obama : Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.
Barack Obama : It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.
Barack Obama : One is nuclear proliferation.
Barack Obama : They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.
Barack Obama : This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons.
Barack Obama : That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia.
Barack Obama : But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.
Barack Obama : You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?
Barack Obama : And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.
Jim Lehrer : Two minutes on Russia, Senator McCain.
John McCain : Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia.
John McCain : "His first statement was, ""Both sides ought to show restraint."""
John McCain : Again, a little bit of naivete there.
John McCain : He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.
John McCain : And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government.
John McCain : "I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""
John McCain : And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.
John McCain : I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.
John McCain : I am sure that that will not happen.
John McCain : But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies.
John McCain : And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.
John McCain : It had everything to do with energy.
John McCain : There's a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey.
John McCain : And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.
John McCain : It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.
John McCain : And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.
John McCain : Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.
John McCain : We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement.
John McCain : They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
John McCain : By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster.
John McCain : And this is -- this is Georgian territory.
John McCain : "And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""
John McCain : It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia.
John McCain : They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.
John McCain : So, this is a very difficult situation.
John McCain : We want to work with the Russians.
John McCain : But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.
John McCain : And watch Ukraine.
John McCain : This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol.
John McCain : And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.
John McCain : So watch Ukraine, and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.
Jim Lehrer : You see any -- do you have a major difference with what he just said?
Barack Obama : No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.
Barack Obama : Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.
Barack Obama : I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.
Barack Obama : And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.
Barack Obama : Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.
Barack Obama : Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.
Barack Obama : Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.
Barack Obama : So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.
Barack Obama : That made no sense whatsoever.
Barack Obama : And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.
Barack Obama : That wasn't done.
Barack Obama : But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.
Barack Obama : The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy.
Barack Obama : Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.
Barack Obama : That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.
Barack Obama : And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.
Barack Obama : So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.
Barack Obama : What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.
Barack Obama : And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.
Barack Obama : And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.
Barack Obama : Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.
Barack Obama : And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.
Jim Lehrer : We've got time for one more lead question segment.
Jim Lehrer : We're way out of...
Jim Lehrer : (CROSSTALK)
Jim Lehrer : Quick response and then...
Jim Lehrer : (CROSSTALK)
John McCain : No one from Arizona is against solar.
John McCain : And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing.
John McCain : So...
Barack Obama : That's just not true, John.
Barack Obama : John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.
John McCain : ... it's hard to get there from here.
John McCain : And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.
John McCain : And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements.
John McCain : And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.
Barack Obama : I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.
John McCain : So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...
Jim Lehrer : Excuse me, Senator.
Barack Obama : John?
John McCain : ...
John McCain : I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.
John McCain : That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.
Barack Obama : I -- I just have to correct the record here.
Barack Obama : I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.
Barack Obama : What I've said is that we have to store it safely.
Barack Obama : And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.
Jim Lehrer : All right.
Barack Obama : I've got to make this point, Jim.
Jim Lehrer : OK.
Barack Obama : He objects...
John McCain : I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...
Barack Obama : He -- he -- he objects...
Barack Obama : (CROSSTALK)
Jim Lehrer : One at a time, please.
Barack Obama : He objected...
Jim Lehrer : One at a time.
John McCain : No one can be opposed to alternate energy.
Barack Obama : All right, fair enough.
Barack Obama : Let's move on.
Barack Obama : You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.
Jim Lehrer : This is the last -- last lead question.
Jim Lehrer : You have two minutes each.
Jim Lehrer : And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain.
Jim Lehrer : What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental United States?
John McCain : I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11.
John McCain : I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.
John McCain : And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.
John McCain : I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.
John McCain : But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.
John McCain : And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.
John McCain : And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.
John McCain : And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40.
John McCain : And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.
John McCain : I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.
John McCain : So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.
John McCain : We have to do a better job in human intelligence.
John McCain : And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.
John McCain : We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.
John McCain : We have to work more closely with our allies.
John McCain : I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.
John McCain : But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.
John McCain : But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.
John McCain : And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.
John McCain : And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.
John McCain : But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.
Jim Lehrer : Two minutes, Senator Obama.
Barack Obama : Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.
Barack Obama : Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.
Barack Obama : We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.
Barack Obama : We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.
Barack Obama : We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.
Barack Obama : And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.
Barack Obama : It's in a suitcase.
Barack Obama : This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.
Barack Obama : It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.
Barack Obama : And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.
Barack Obama : And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.
Barack Obama : The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida.
Barack Obama : They are now operating in 60 countries.
Barack Obama : We can't simply be focused on Iraq.
Barack Obama : We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Barack Obama : That's going to be critical.
Barack Obama : We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.
Barack Obama : And one last point I want to make.
Barack Obama : It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.
Barack Obama : And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.
Barack Obama : We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.
Barack Obama : And this is the greatest country on Earth.
Barack Obama : But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.
Jim Lehrer : Do you agree there's much to be done in a new administration to restore...
Jim Lehrer : (CROSSTALK)
John McCain : "But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven."""
John McCain : That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense.
John McCain : And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.
John McCain : We seem to come full circle again.
John McCain : Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.
John McCain : They would establish a base in Iraq.
John McCain : The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.
John McCain : All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.
John McCain : And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.
John McCain : And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.
John McCain : That is the central issue of our time.
John McCain : And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.
Jim Lehrer : You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?
Barack Obama : Oh, there's no doubt.
Barack Obama : Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.
Barack Obama : That has been their priority.
Barack Obama : That has been where all our resources have gone.
Barack Obama : In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.
Barack Obama : He is not captured.
Barack Obama : He is not killed.
Barack Obama : Al Qaida is resurgent.
Barack Obama : In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.
Barack Obama : They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.
Barack Obama : And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa.
Barack Obama : They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.
Barack Obama : We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.
Barack Obama : We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.
Barack Obama : And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.
Barack Obama : We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.
Barack Obama : There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.
Barack Obama : So this is a national security issue.
Barack Obama : We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.
Barack Obama : "I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, ""How can I get disability payments?"
Barack Obama : "I've got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can't get treatment."""
Barack Obama : So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.
Barack Obama : What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.
Barack Obama : That's been missing over the last eight years.
Barack Obama : That sense is something that I want to restore.
John McCain : I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years.
John McCain : There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.
John McCain : And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.
John McCain : As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans.
John McCain : I know them well.
John McCain : And I know that they know that I'll take care of them.
John McCain : And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.
John McCain : And I love them.
John McCain : And I'll take care of them.
John McCain : And they know that I'll take care of them.
John McCain : And that's going to be my job.
John McCain : But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.
John McCain : Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.
John McCain : I don't think I need any on-the-job training.
John McCain : I'm ready to go at it right now.
Barack Obama : Well, let me just make a closing point.
Barack Obama : You know, my father came from Kenya.
Barack Obama : That's where I get my name.
Barack Obama : And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried.
Barack Obama : The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.
Barack Obama : I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.
Barack Obama : And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.
Barack Obama : And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.
Jim Lehrer : Few seconds.
Jim Lehrer : We're almost finished.
John McCain : Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad.
John McCain : And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.
John McCain : I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.
Jim Lehrer : And that ends this debate tonight.
Jim Lehrer : On October 2nd, next Thursday, also at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time, the two vice presidential candidates will debate at Washington University in St. Louis.
Jim Lehrer : My PBS colleague, Gwen Ifill, will be the moderator.
Jim Lehrer : For now, from Oxford, Mississippi, thank you, senators, both.
Jim Lehrer : I'm Jim Lehrer.
Jim Lehrer : Thank you, and good night.
Jim Lehrer : (APPLAUSE)
Jim Lehrer : END
